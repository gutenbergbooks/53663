<span class="smaller">MISS CISSY’S PLAN</span></h2>

<p>“There now! You’re done!” exclaimed Hannah,
the nurse, giving Priscilla an approving pat and looking
her over carefully from head to heels to see that
nothing was amiss. “Now you’ll please to sit in this
chair, like a little lady, and not stir, else you’ll rumple
your pretty frock and then your mamma will be displeased,
for she will want you to look just right before
all the company down-stairs. Your grandpapa
and grandmamma, and uncles and aunts, and Cousin
Cicely&mdash;all the line folks who have come to take dinner
with you and bring you lovely birthday presents.
So up you go!”</p>

<p>Priscilla suffered herself to be lifted into the big
armchair without a word and then sat obediently
still, watching Hannah, as she bustled about the nursery
“tidying up” as she called it.</p>

<p>Priscilla was a very quiet little girl, with great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
solemn brown eyes, a small, sober mouth and a quantity
of soft, bright hair that had to be brushed so often
it made her eyes water just to think of it.</p>

<p>This was her eighth birthday. Now, when strangers
asked her, as they always did, “how old she was” she
could reply “Going on nine,” but she would still be
compelled to give the same old answer to their next
familiar question of, “And have you any brothers and
sisters?” for Priscilla was an only child.</p>

<p>She sometimes wondered what they meant when
they shook their heads and murmured, “Such a
pity! Poor little thing!” for when Theresa, the
parlor-maid, whom, by the way, Priscilla did not
like very much, came up to the nursery and saw all
her wonderful toys and the new frocks and hats
and coats that were continually being sent home
to her, she always said sharply and with a curl
of the lip: “My! But isn’t she a lucky child! It
must be grand to be such a rich little thing!” For
how can one be “a pity” and “lucky” at the same
time? and “a poor little thing” and a “rich little
thing” at once?</p>

<p>Priscilla did not like to enquire of her mamma or
Hannah about it, for she had once been very sick with
a pain in her head, and the doctors had come, and she
was in bed for a long time, and after that she had
been told not to ask questions. And whenever she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sat, as she loved to do, very quietly on the nursery
couch, trying to puzzle things out for herself, Hannah
would come and bid her “stop her studyin’” and go
and play with her dolls, explaining that “little girls
never would grow big and strong and beautiful like
their Cousin Cicely if they sat still all the time and
bothered their brains about things they couldn’t understand.”
So it was not as hard for Priscilla as it
might have been for some other little girls to “sit still
like a lady” in the big armchair, and she was just beginning
to have “a nice time with her mind” when
there was a knock upon the door and James the butler,
announced in his grand, deep voice, “Dinner is served.
And your mamma says as ’ow she wishes you to
come down, miss.”</p>

<p>She waited for Hannah to lift her to the floor, bade
her good-bye very politely and then tripped daintily
down the long halls and softly carpeted staircases to
the dining-room, where there was a great stir and
murmur of voices and what seemed to Priscilla a vast
crowd of people. She knew them all well, of course;
grandpapa and grandmamma; Uncle Arthur Hamilton,
who was the husband of Aunt Laura; Uncle
Robert and Aunt Louise Duer; dear Cousin Cissy, and
her papa and mamma. They were all very old and
familiar friends, but when they were collected together
they seemed strange and “different” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
frightened her very much. Her heart always beat exceedingly
fast as she moved about from one to the
other saying, “Yes, aunt” and “No, uncle,” so many
times in succession. When she entered the room now
the hum of voices suddenly stopped and then, the next
instant, broke out afresh and louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Dear child! Why, I do believe she’s grown!”</p>

<p>“Bless her heart, so she has!”</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t grow stout.”</p>

<p>“Nor rosy.”</p>

<p>“Come, my pet, and kiss grandpapa!”</p>

<p>“What a big girl grandmamma has got! Eight
years old! Just fancy!”</p>

<p>“Do let me have her for a moment. I must have a
kiss this second.”</p>

<p>Priscilla heaved a deep sigh under the lace of her
frock at which, to her embarrassment, all the company
laughed and dear Cousin Cicely said:</p>

<p>“She’s bored to death with all our attention and I
don’t wonder. It is a nuisance to have to kiss so many
people. There, Priscilla darling, you shall sit right
here, next to Cousin Cissy, and no one shall bother
you any more.”</p>

<p>Dinner down here in the big dining-room was always
a very slow and tiresome affair in Priscilla’s
estimation. She liked her own nursery-dinner best,
which she ate in the middle of the day, with Hannah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sitting by to see that the baked potatoes were well
done and the beef rare enough. This “down-stairs-dinner”
to-night was no less long and wearisome than
usual, but at last it was done and then Priscilla was
carried in state to the drawing-room upon the
shoulder of tall Uncle Arthur Hamilton, and at the
head of a long procession of laughing and chattering
relations who, she knew, would stand around in a
great, embarrassing circle and watch her as she
examined the beautiful birthday gifts they had
brought her.</p>

<p>And behold! There was a large table in the
middle of the room, and it was covered with a white
cloth and piled high with wonderful things. Dolls
that walked and dolls that talked; books and games
and music-boxes. A doll’s kitchen and a doll’s carriage;
a little piano with “really-truly” white and
black ivory keys, and all sorts and sizes of fine silk,
and velvet boxes containing gold chains and rings
and pins, with pretty glittering stones.</p>

<p>Uncle Arthur lifted Priscilla from his shoulder and
set her down upon the floor before the table, where
she stood in silence, looking wistfully at her new
treasures, but not quite knowing what to do about them.</p>

<p>“See this splendid dolly, Priscilla! She can say
ever so many French words. Don’t you want to
hear her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen to this lovely music-box, Priscilla! What
pretty tunes it can play!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to hang this beautiful chain
around your neck, Priscilla? It will look so pretty
on your white dress.”</p>

<p>Priscilla gazed from one thing to another, as they
were thrust before her and tried to be polite, as Hannah
had told her to be, but she felt dizzy and bewildered
and could only stand still, clasping and unclasping
her hands in front of her.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t believe she cares for them at
all,” said Aunt Louise in a surprised and disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>“Embarrassment of riches, perhaps,” suggested
Uncle Robert, her husband.</p>

<p>“Here, Priscilla, dear,” broke in Aunt Laura. “See
this wonderful new dolly that can walk! Now, you
must certainly play with her. Why, when I was a
little girl I would have been delighted if my uncles and
aunts had given me such splendid things! I would
not have stood, as you are doing, and looked as if I
did not care for them.”</p>

<p>Priscilla obediently took the accomplished dolly
from her Aunt Laura’s hands and held it loosely in
her arms, but she did not make any attempt to “play
with her prettily.” Aunt Laura frowned.</p>

<p>Grandmamma came forward and passed her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about Priscilla’s waist. “Our dear little girl ought
to be very happy with so many people to love her,”
she said, softly. Somehow her tone, kind as it was,
made Priscilla feel she was being naughty because she
was not so happy as grandmamma thought she ought
to be. She would have liked to be obedient and to
please her relations, but if she was not doing so by
being very proper, and saying, “Yes, aunt,” and “No,
uncle,” in answer to their questions, she did not know
what else they wanted. It puzzled and bewildered
her, and then the first thing she knew, the dolly had
fallen from her arms to the floor with a crash, where
it lay foolishly kicking its legs and sawing the air
with its arms, while she herself was sobbing big tears
over her nice clean dress in a way that she knew
would most dreadfully provoke Hannah.</p>

<p>In a twinkling she was in her mother’s arms, and
there was a great stir and murmur of voices about
her. No one could understand what was the matter.</p>

<p>“She must be sick,” observed Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>“Perhaps something about the doll hurt her&mdash;a pin
in its clothes maybe,” suggested Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she like toys?” asked Uncle Robert.</p>

<p>“We grown-ups frighten her, poor youngster. There
are a good many of us, you know, and you are not all
as handsome as I am,” laughed Uncle Arthur, mischievously,
“are they, Priscilla?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, she certainly is an odd child not to be perfectly
delighted with so many nice things. When I
was a little girl&mdash;&mdash;” reiterated Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>But just then Hannah appeared at the door and
Priscilla’s mother murmured in her ear, “Say ‘Good-night
all,’ my darling, ‘and thank you for giving me
such a happy birthday.’”</p>

<p>“Good-night all, and thank you for giving me such
a happy birthday,” whispered Priscilla with a sobbing
catch in her voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” responded Uncle Arthur, bowing
low.</p>

<p>And then Hannah led her off to bed.</p>

<p>But that was by no means the end of her birthday,
although she thought it was. Long after she was
safely asleep in her little brass bed the grown-up
people down-stairs were still talking about her. It
seemed so remarkable to them that she had not shown
more interest in the beautiful things they had prepared
for her.</p>

<p>“Priscilla was never a very demonstrative child,”
said her mother a little sadly, as if she were excusing
her.</p>

<p>“But her heart is in the right place, nevertheless,”
her father declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that,” broke in Aunt Laura. “She is a
dear little girl, of course, but&mdash;all I mean is, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
doesn’t act as a child ought to act; as a healthy child
ought to act. She ought to be full of spirits, jumping
about and laughing and playing. Now when I was a
little girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you quite understand Priscilla, dear
Aunt Laura,” a bright young voice interrupted
quickly. “She is naturally a quiet, timid little thing.
She would never be boisterous, but you are right in
this, that she doesn’t act as a child of her age might
be expected to act, and the reason is, she is lonely.
She has never known other children. She has never
learned to play. Now these presents here are all very
fine in their way, but they do not really interest her,
because she does not know how to use them.”</p>

<p>“But dear me,” observed Aunt Laura, “why doesn’t
somebody teach her? I wound up the walking-doll
for her myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely smiled. “I do not mean that,” she replied.
“You couldn’t teach her and I couldn’t, because&mdash;we’ve
forgotten how. The only one who
could teach her would be a little girl of about her own
age; a playmate. Believe me, the best present we
could give Priscilla would be a companion; a flesh-and-blood
little girl who could share her pretty things,
and who would teach her how to enjoy them.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Aunt Laura. “What a
very curious creature you are, Cicely. Give Priscilla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a present of a ‘flesh-and-blood little girl!’ ‘A playmate
of about her own age!’ Fancy!”</p>

<p>“I know you all think I am too young to know
anything about bringing up children,” continued Miss
Cissy, “and you all, being older, are very much wiser
than I am. But I remember when I was a little
girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop right there, Cicely,” interrupted Uncle
Arthur. “No one in this family but your Aunt
Laura has any right to remember when she was a
little girl.”</p>

<p>Pretty Cicely pretended to frown at him, but her
merry eyes laughed in spite of themselves, though she
went on at once: “I was the only child in the family
then, just as Priscilla is now, and it was a very lonesome
position, I assure you, so I can sympathize with
her. I used to long and long for the chance to romp
and play with other children of my own age, but I
was always surrounded by a lot of servants whose business
it was to see that I was very sedate and proper
and who were made to feel that I was altogether too
important and elegant a little personage to be allowed
to associate with the rest of the world. So I saw
from afar other children having jolly times and I had
to be contented, myself, with my fine playthings and
splendid clothes. They did not at all content me. I
knew then, just as Priscilla does now, that such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cannot make one happy. Children are like grown-up
people in this: that they are never really healthy or
happy until they share their good things with some
one else.”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” cried Uncle Arthur, clapping his
hands approvingly.</p>

<p>Cicely’s whole face was aglow with earnestness and
hope as she concluded: “There! now, I have had my
say and I am sorry it has been such a long one, but I
simply had to speak out, you know.”</p>

<p>“But think of the chances there are of Priscilla’s
catching chicken-pox and measles and influenza, if she
plays with other children,” suggested Aunt Louise
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Children nowadays are so shamefully ill-behaved.
They are regular little ruffians. Fancy how wretched
it would be if Priscilla caught their horrid habits and
became pert and forward and unmannerly,” added
Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>Cicely nodded brightly. “Yes, of course that is so,”
she admitted, “but on the other hand, fancy how
splendid it would be if Priscilla played with other
children and caught happiness and health from them,
and generosity and kindness and sympathy. Good
things are catching as well as bad, don’t you think
they are, Aunt Laura?”</p>

<p>This time Uncle Arthur did not cry “Hear!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Hear!” but he came straight over to where Cicely
sat and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>“Cissy, my dear,” he said, quite seriously, “let
me congratulate you. You are the wisest member
of the family, by all odds and,” with a twinkle in his
eye, “for your sake I am glad I married your Aunt
Laura. If Priscilla turns out as well as you have
done the Duers will have no cause to be ashamed of
their two representatives&mdash;even though they are
‘only girls.’”</p>

<p>But just here Priscilla’s mother spoke up:</p>

<p>“I wonder what your plan is, Cissy, dear,” she said.
“We are anxious, of course, to do whatever is for
Priscilla’s good and I can see that she may be lonely,
living so entirely with older people, but&mdash;&mdash; Do you
think a kindergarten&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, dear Aunt Edith, that is not at all what I
mean,” Cicely broke in quickly. “What I mean is,
that Priscilla ought to have a playmate&mdash;a child&mdash;to
live right here in the house with her; one who would
rouse her up and keep her from growing moody and
oversensitive. A little girl who would share her
good things with her and to whom Priscilla would
have to give up and give in once in a while. Each
would learn from the other and I’m sure you would
see that Priscilla would improve directly, in health
and in every other way. Please, please, Aunt Edith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
try my plan. I assure you it would work like a
charm, if we got the right child and gave the experiment
time.”</p>

<p>“We will!”</p>

<p>It was Priscilla’s father who spoke and, of course,
his word settled the matter at once. But now the
question arose where was “the right child” to be
found? It came over Cicely with a sudden shock,
that nothing less than a little cherub right out of the
sky would suit all these extremely particular people,
for no mere human child could possibly fulfil all
their requirements.</p>

<p>Aunt Louise would insist upon her never, by any
chance, being sick. Aunt Laura would demand that
she always be perfectly quiet and faultlessly well-behaved.
Aunt Edith would wish her to be older
than Priscilla so Priscilla could rely upon her, and
grandmamma desired her to be younger than Priscilla
so Priscilla could learn to be self-reliant: and so it
went on.</p>

<p>“As far as I can see, Cicely,” spoke up Uncle Arthur,
teasingly, “this scheme of yours is first-rate!
Quite as good, for instance, as the well-known recipe
for cooking a hare, which begins ‘first catch your
hare.’ In this case it is: first catch your child. It
is clearly your place to produce the prodigy. Now
then, my dear, let’s see what sort of a marvel you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
discover. It will have to be a superfine article to be
fit to associate with the great and only Hope (but
one, that’s you) of the Duer family.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what it is,” suggested Cicely. “Let’s
all try to find one. And the best, by common consent,
shall be Priscilla’s playmate. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>There was a great chorus of “Yesses”; a lot of
hand-shaking and laughing and fun, and very shortly
after the company went home, while up-stairs Priscilla
slept peacefully on in her pretty brass bed, never
dreaming of the curious birthday present she was to
receive in the course of the next few days.</p>

<p>When Miss Cicely Duer made up her mind to do a
thing, she generally succeeded in doing it and she had
determined to prove that her plan was a good one. So,
first of all, she set to work putting the family in good
humor. “For,” she said to herself, “they are ever so
much more likely to be reasonable if they are in a
cheerful frame of mind.” So she straightway wrote
out a number of very elegant invitations bidding
Grandpapa and Grandmamma Duer, Uncle Robert
and Aunt Louise Duer, Uncle Arthur and Aunt Laura
Hamilton, Uncle Elliot and Aunt Edith Duer, and
Father and Mother Duer, “to come to Priscilla’s unbirthday
party on Thursday afternoon, February 10th,
at three o’clock and to bring with them, each and
every couple, a little girl not over twelve years of
age and not under six. The grandpapa and grandmamma
or uncle and aunt bringing the nicest little
girl will receive a prize. R.S.V.P.”</p>

<p>The invitations were sent out promptly and the
answers came in without delay. Not one member of
the family sent a regret: every one was “Pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
accept Miss Cicely Duer’s kind invitation to Miss
Priscilla Duer’s unbirthday party,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>“It is just like the Queen and Alice,” laughed Miss
Cicely merrily, but her face grew sober as she thought
of the search she would probably have before she
could get anything like the right sort of little girl “to
set before the king,” for the right sort of little girl
doesn’t grow on every bush and Miss Cicely knew it,
and even if it did its parents would not be likely to
want to give it away.</p>

<p>“I shall not insist on her being pretty, of course,
but she mustn’t be utterly hideous,” the young lady
thought. “I don’t want her to be a goody-goody
little prig but I can’t possibly have a young demon.
Oh, dear me! Suppose I cannot find a child at all
and have to go to the party without my share of
small girl! How they will poke fun at me! It
would be another case of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Smarty, Smarty gave a party,</div>
<div class="verse">Nobody came but Smarty, Smarty.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her mind was so full of her mission, that one day
while she was shopping she found herself replying to
a salesman before whose counter she stood, “Yes,
please. I want one between six and twelve. Truthful
and not too mischievous,” and she only realized
her mistake when he paused in measuring off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
yards of silk she had selected and looked at her as if
he thought she was mildly insane and ought to be
carefully guarded.</p>

<p>Miss Cicely blushed furiously and tried to hide her
embarrassment with a laugh. The shopman laughed
too and Miss Cicely, to explain her absurd blunder,
confided to him that she was really looking for a little
girl between six and twelve years of age who was
truthful and not too mischievous, and did they keep
any of the sort in stock?</p>

<p>The salesman laughed again.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, madam, we do,” he replied. “Most of
them are somewhat older than you want, to be sure,
but we have one, at least right here now, that, come
to think of it, ought to just fill the bill. Here!
Cash! Cash one-hundred-and-five! Cash! Cash!”</p>

<p>As the salesman said no more Miss Cicely concluded
he had merely replied to her joking question
with a joking answer. He made out her bill-of-sale
and placed it with her yards of silk and then again
rapped upon his counter with the blunt end of his
lead-pencil, repeating: “Cash! One-hundred-and
five! Here, Cash!”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely felt vaguely disappointed. Of course
she had known that, even in such a great department
store as this, they did not have little girls on sale, but
the shopman’s manner and his reply to her laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
question had been so serious that, for a flash, she had
really thought he was in earnest when he said he
thought they had one that might “just fill the bill.”</p>

<p>“It was very clever of him to carry out the joke so
completely, any one would have thought him in earnest;
but&mdash;well,&mdash;Miss Cicely was disappointed. She
had searched and searched and not even the wee-est
sample of a nice little girl had she been able so far to
find. And Thursday was the day after to-morrow!</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” she mused, “what in the world shall
I do? The only place I haven’t tried is ‘The Home
for Friendless Children’ and I purposely avoided it
because I knew grandmamma and the aunts would fly
there the first thing, and I thought I’d be superior and
discover something quite original. Well, I suppose it
serves me right! and my pride ought to go before a
fall. But there’s nothing left but an institution evidently!
Oh, me! I wonder if there would be a presentable
little waif at the Orphan Asylum? Positively
I must go there at once and see. How long
one has to wait at these shops! Why doesn’t that
Cash come?”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely grew almost irritable as she thought of
her defeat. She had quite given up the idea of
taking the prize at the contest she herself had arranged,
but she could not face the ridicule that she
knew would be heaped upon her by the family if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
after all her fine talk, she failed to “produce” a
“specimen” at all. Oh, dear! Why didn’t that
Cash&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Cash! Cash! One hundred-and-five!” called
the salesman a third time.</p>

<p>A very thin, small arm was thrust forward toward
the counter from between Miss Cicely and the crowding
shopper next to her and a very small breathless
voice replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Here, sir! Cash one-hundred-and-five,
sir!”</p>

<p>The salesman nodded.</p>

<p>“This is the one I was speaking about, madam,” he
said turning to Miss Cicely and indicating the arm
and the voice just beside her.</p>

<p>Miss Cissy bent her head and looked down. There,
at her elbow, almost crushed flat by the crowd, and
breathless with running, stood a little errand-girl.
She could not have been more than ten years old,
but her great anxious eyes and the little grown-up
furrow between her brows made her appear much
older. Miss Cissy saw her small hand tremble as she
handed the salesman her basket, and noticed, also in a
flash, that it was a clean hand and that the shabby-sleeve
through which it was thrust, was clean also.
Miss Cicely moved to make room for the mite of a
business-woman. The business-woman looked up&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the next moment Miss Cicely had put an arm
about her.</p>

<p>“So you are Cash one-hundred-and-five?” she inquired,
kindly drawing her to her side.</p>

<p>The child nodded, murmuring, “Yes’m,” and shoved
her basket toward the salesman who pretended
to busy himself putting the silk and bill-of-sale
into it.</p>

<p>“And how old are you, I wonder?” pursued Miss
Cissy.</p>

<p>“Ten, ’m,” answered Cash, feeling worried at these
unbusinesslike interruptions, but trying not to let
the fine lady see it.</p>

<p>“And your name is&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Ca&mdash;I mean Polly&mdash;Polly Carter please, ’m.”</p>

<p>“Polly is one of our best cash-girls, madam,” put in
the salesman quietly. “I don’t know what we’d do
without Polly. She’s so quick and ready, we all try
to get her to carry to the desk for us, and that’s why
she didn’t come at my first call. She wasn’t loitering.
She was just rushed with business. That’s what
comes of being reliable and popular. Polly can
always be trusted and she’s never cross.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is a royal recommendation!” said Miss
Cissy approvingly. “Now, I wonder how it happens
that Polly is a cash-girl? Hasn’t she anybody to take
care of her? No father or mother?”</p>

<p class="caption">MISS CICELY HAD HER ARM AROUND HER</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re dead, ’m,” answered Polly promptly. “I
have a big sister and she used to take care of me and
send me to school. She worked here. She was behind
a counter. And she did needlework besides, oh, beautiful
needlework! but she got hurted last winter run
over by a truck, and both her legs were under the
wheels and&mdash;so now&mdash;I take care of her, and the
s’ciety lets me ’cause I study when I’m through here,
and sister, she teaches me and I’m never sick and it’s
nec’ary, ’cause sister can’t do anything but her needlework
now.”</p>

<p>Miss Cissy’s arm tightened about the waist of the
little bread-winner.</p>

<p>“Where does your big sister live?” she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Polly gave the down-town east-side street and
number and then reached out for her basket. She felt
that she could not spare any more time to her personal
affairs in business hours, even for such an elegant
customer as this.</p>

<p>“Well, Polly, I’m very glad to have met you,” said
Miss Cicely, “and I hope we shall see each other
again. Here is a bright, new fifty-cent piece for you.
Won’t you take it, please, and buy yourself something
with it&mdash;whatever you like best.”</p>

<p>It gave Miss Cissy a thrill to see Polly’s face as she
took the bit of shining silver; all in a flash it changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from the face of a little careworn woman to that of a
dimpled child.</p>

<p>“I’ll get sister a book,” she cried happily. “I
thank you ever so much!”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s actually pretty,” thought Miss Cissy and
she pictured to herself Cash one-hundred-and-five clad
in a neat white frock, with hair cut square round her
neck and tied with crisp ribbon-bows over her temples.
“She’ll do. Most certainly she’ll do. Now, if I can
only get her!” she thought.</p>

<p>She was so entertained by her visions of the
imagined Polly that it did not seem a second before the
actual one had returned with her bundle and change.
Miss Cissy took them from the salesman and, with a
twinkle in her eyes, thanked him for helping her to
find just the article she wanted. Then she hurried
out into the street where her carriage was awaiting
her.</p>

<p>It was a long, rough ride over the uneven stones of
the down-town streets, but Miss Cissy did not care for
little inconveniences. She was too full of hope to
mind the jolts and jars that made the coachman grind
his teeth. She readily found the tenement in which
“big sister” lived and she had no trouble in finding
“big sister” herself. The big sister who, by the
way, was not, as it happened, big at all, but quite
little, in fact, heard Miss Cissy out very patiently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
She seemed used to listening to a great deal of talk
and to seeing a great many strange, fine ladies, and to
not allowing herself to be bewildered by their
promises or them. She was extremely quiet and gave
no sign of either pleasure or surprise as the splendid
plans for Polly’s welfare were unfolded to her. How
was she to know that this fine lady was in earnest
and would prove as good as her word?</p>

<p>When Miss Cissy had quite finished she said slowly:</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to offer to help us. It would
be a grand thing for me, of course, to go to a hospital
and be treated right, and I think your little cousin
would like Polly, but&mdash;it would be very bad for Polly
if, after she had had a taste of easy living, she’d have
to go back to the cash-running again and&mdash;this,”
pointing to the poor room. “I don’t think I’d better
risk it for her, miss. Polly is a cheerful little soul,
but you can’t tell, it might make her discontented
later.”</p>

<p>But Miss Cicely was not one to be easily discouraged.
She reassured and she explained, she argued and she
urged.</p>

<p>At last big sister spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m bound to tell you this, miss,” she said anxiously.
“You say your little cousin doesn’t know
how to play&mdash;well, by the same token, neither does
Polly, I’m afraid. Polly’s always been, as you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
say, old for her age, and the last year she’s done nothing
but work and wait on me. I’m afraid she’s forgotten
how to frolic as children do&mdash;ought, I mean.
The ‘little mothers,’ as they call them down here,
haven’t much time for fun. Not but that she couldn’t
learn, you know. And it all might come back to her,
for she used to be as playful as a kitten, and there’s
lots of life in her yet, poor lamb! But the cash-running
has taken it out of her a lot. It might not be
a good thing to put a child that has seen so much worry,
with your little cousin that hasn’t seen any.”</p>

<p>“I know it&mdash;I have thought of that&mdash;” interrupted
Miss Cissy eagerly,&mdash;“but children don’t take
things to heart as we older ones are apt to do. I
mean they don’t brood over their ills, and I know that
after Polly gets rested she’ll forget her worries and
be as gay as a lark. I saw it in her face when I gave
her a bit of money. She changed, all in a twinkling,
and was as plump and jolly as any child need be. Do
let her come! I know she’ll be the one chosen for the
place and think what it will mean if you can get
proper care and treatment. It is possible you might
really be cured. Think what it would mean to be
really cured!”</p>

<p>Big sister’s eyes filled with tears. “Don’t speak of
that, please,” she said hurriedly. “I am trying not to
think of it. If I let you have Polly it won’t be because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of what I’d get by it, I want you to believe that.
It will be for the good that will come to the child
herself. But I can’t answer you now anyway. I
must think it over. And I must find out if Polly
would be willing. Of course I would not tell her just
how the case stands, for I don’t want her to know she
will be on trial. It would make her ‘show off’
maybe, and then, too, I think Polly’s a dear, but I
know there are many children much prettier and
more taking than she is. It’s more likely than not
that she wouldn’t get the place at all, and then, if she
knew, she would be disappointed. I’ll let you know&mdash;say,
Thursday morning. Will that do? That will
give me to-day and to-morrow to consider. I don’t
want to do anything hasty that, later, I’d be sorry
for.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you possibly make it to-morrow?” pleaded
Miss Cissy earnestly. “I’ll send a messenger down to
you to-morrow. I want time too&mdash;I want time to get
a few things ready before Thursday and&mdash;and&mdash;please
do!”</p>

<p>Big sister thought it over for a moment. Then she
nodded her head assentingly.</p>

<p>“All right, I will, miss, I’ll let you know to-morrow,”
she said.</p>

<p>So it was settled and Miss Cicely drove away, if not
quite in triumph, at least having gained a partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
victory. She knew there would be no difficulty in
getting Polly’s dismissal from the store. The firm
would be glad to oblige so valuable a customer as Miss
Duer, and she “felt it in her bones,” as she said to herself,
that she would receive a satisfactory word next
day from big sister. And, sure enough, she did.
Early Wednesday forenoon her messenger brought
back the intelligence that big sister was willing, and
so was Polly, and that if Miss Cicely could arrange it
with the store it would be all right.</p>

<p>How Miss Cissy did fly around after that! She
astonished the superintendent at the store by flashing
in upon him, with a demand for Cash one-hundred-and-five,
and flashing out again with his consent to
take her. Then she astonished Polly by popping her
up-stairs into the “Misses’ Furnishing Department”
and having her fitted out from head to heels in new
clothes. Shiny black shoes and spotless white stockings;
a lot of neat underclothes with trimmings at the
edges, such as Polly had never even dreamed of before;
a “sweet” white frock; a warm outer coat; a big felt
hat with ribbons on it, and, last of all, and wonder of
wonders! gloves and handkerchiefs and ribbons for
her hair! Then off flew Miss Cissy to the hospital to
arrange matters for big sister. Then back home
again through the evening darkness and just in time
to dress for dinner. She had not stopped to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
how tired she was, and she did not now, but she was
glad when she was at last able to go to her own room
and to bed. It had been a long, and busy day.</p>

<p>The next morning she waked with the feeling that
great things were to be accomplished, and before she
was fairly dressed there was a knock upon her door,
and on the threshold stood Polly with the maid who
had gone down-town to bring her up. It seemed to
Miss Cissy almost like playing dolls again to be washing
and dressing this little girl; cutting her hair in a
straight line around her neck, tying it with two bits
of rosy ribbon over her temples, and slipping on her
pretty underclothes and dainty frock.</p>

<p>The anxious look had faded from Polly’s eyes and
the anxious furrows had disappeared from between
her brows when, at length, she stood before Miss
Cicely’s cheval-glass all “booted and spurred and fit
for the fight” as her hostess merrily sang. They had
a cozy luncheon up-stairs&mdash;just Miss Cissy and Polly
together&mdash;at which Polly was so excited she could
hardly eat. It seemed as if it would never be three
o’clock and time to go to the party, but at last it was
time and then off they rolled in, what seemed to Polly,
the most splendid carriage in the world; just exactly
as if she were Cinderella herself and Miss Cissy the
Fairy-Godmother.</p>

<p>By this time Polly knew about Priscilla, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but she did not know about the other children who,
like herself, were to be brought to Priscilla’s home,
the best to be chosen for Priscilla’s playmate. She
just thought she was going to a party and to make a
long visit afterwards, for Miss Cicely had decided that
if Polly were not voted the best, and another child
was selected in her stead she herself would keep the
little girl for a while, at least, and in the meantime
big sister should be sent to a hospital where she would
receive the best of treatment and the kindest of care.</p>

<p>So, when the carriage came to a halt before the
great house in which Priscilla lived, Polly’s little heart
beat quick with pleasure and excitement. To go to a
real party! In brand-new clothes! Why it was just
too good to be true! Miss Cicely looked into the
bright little face and sparkling eyes and was glad that
Polly did not know the real state of the case&mdash;that,
in fact, her present and, maybe her future, was to
depend on the way she behaved at Priscilla’s “unbirthday
party.” It might have sobered her happy
heart had she known it, for Polly, young as she was,
had felt responsibility before, and would have realized
what a heavy one lay upon her now. But she did not
know and Miss Cicely did not give her the least little
bit of a hint.</p>

<p>“I want her to be quite herself&mdash;quite natural,” she
thought. “That will be the only way to decide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
stuff she’s made of, and whether she is really the best
or not.”</p>

<p>So Polly and Miss Cissy went hand-in-hand up the
broad flight of steps, from the street. A big door
was mysteriously opened as soon as they reached the
top, and then, as it closed behind them, Polly heard a
loud hum of voices, saw a soft flood of light and knew
she was really at the party.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE BEST OF ALL THE GAME”</span></h2>

<p>Miss Cicely herself led Polly up-stairs and into a
splendid room, where with her own hands, she unfastened
the little girl’s coat and slipped off her hat
and gloves. There was a fine young woman present
who seemed to Polly to have manners which were
ever so much prouder and haughtier than Miss Cissy’s
and whose jaunty cap sat like a stiff crown upon her
head, while her embroidered apron and white collar
and cuffs were the crispest Polly had ever seen, and
this dignified personage loftily offered to assist Miss
Cicely, but was refused.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Theresa, I prefer to do it myself,”
Polly’s friend replied easily at once, as she smoothed
out the wrinkles in Polly’s frock and plucked at the
loops of her ribbon-bows. “By the way, are they all
here, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss,” Theresa answered. “You’re the last,
miss.”</p>

<p>“Then we must hurry,” said Miss Cissy, and her
own wraps were cast aside in no time.</p>

<p>She and Polly went down-stairs as they had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
up, hand-in-hand. At the foot Miss Cissy stopped
long enough to give her little companion one last,
careful look and then led her toward the room where
all the talking was. As they entered it Polly heard a
very tall gentleman say:</p>

<p>“Oho! Here she comes at last! We thought she
had deserted. We had been led to believe that it was
customary for a hostess to be present to receive her
guests, but don’t let a little thing like that trouble
you, Cicely. You usually manage to reverse the natural
order of things and as your guests are here to
receive you, it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely laughed and blushed and then the very
tall gentleman suddenly stood extremely erect by the
doorway and announced in a loud, solemn voice:</p>

<p>“Miss Duer and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Polly Carter,” prompted Miss Cissy.</p>

<p>“And Miss Polly Carter!” echoed the gentleman.</p>

<p>If Polly had been used to children’s parties, this
one would have seemed extremely curious to her, for
there appeared to be so few children and so many
grown-up people. By looking very carefully, one
could have discovered five little girls, each of whom
was tucked away somewhere behind or beside one of
the couples of ladies and gentlemen present. None of
the children seemed very glad to be there, and Polly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
who herself made the sixth, was beginning to feel
dimly disappointed, when Miss Cicely spoke up in her
bright, jolly fashion:</p>

<p>“Now, dear people,” she said, “the first thing to do
is to introduce these little girls to one another.
Grandfather and Grandmother Duer, will you kindly
let me present my little guest to yours? This is
Polly Carter.”</p>

<p>A youthful-looking, white-haired old lady and
gentleman arose solemnly from the far end of the
long room, and came forward in a very stately
manner, holding a flaxen-braided young person by the
hand.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Katie Schorr,” announced Grandmamma
Duer, in a voice that trembled a little (though
that could hardly have been from age, for her eyes
and skin were as young and soft as Polly’s own).
“The Superintendent of our Mission Sunday-school
was kind enough to introduce us to Miss Katie Schorr.
He said she was a good, obedient child, and we
believe it.”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely stooped and shook Miss Schorr by the
hand in her own cordial way.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Katie dear,” she said. “I’m glad
to see you here. I hope you will have a good time.
This is Polly Carter. Won’t you two please stand
beside me while I receive the other little friends?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
There, that’s right! Now, Uncle Arthur and Aunt
Laura Hamilton, your guest, please.”</p>

<p>The very tall gentleman, Polly had noticed before,
sprang up and gallantly assisted a handsome lady
from her chair, offering her his arm with a flourish.
She refused the arm at once, saying, “Nonsense, Arthur!
don’t be absurd!” which Polly thought rather
unkind of her. The little girl they brought forward
was so pretty that it was delightful to look at her.
Her name was pretty, too. Angeline Montague!
And she had elegant manners, for when she was introduced
to Miss Cissy she curtseyed beautifully, with
her right hand upon her heart&mdash;or, rather, on the spot
where she supposed her heart was.</p>

<p>As she stepped beside Polly and Katie, Polly heard
“Aunt Laura” say to Miss Cicely in an undertone:</p>

<p>“Most excellent connections, I assure you. Her
mother does my fine sewing. Theresa, up-stairs, recommended
her to me. She says they used to have
means. But the father&mdash;well, he’s in Canada or
somewhere. Very pitiful!”</p>

<p>Polly wondered, while “Uncle Robert and Aunt
Louise” were bringing up their little guest, why it
was pitiful that Angeline’s father was in Canada.
She had supposed, from what the “geografy” said
about Canada, that it was a real nice place.</p>

<p>“‘One, two, three little Indians!’” hummed Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Arthur, as Miss Cicely, with a kind hand on Angeline’s
shoulder, placed her next to Polly and Katie.
“Now then, next customer!”</p>

<p>“Miss Rosy Hartigan!” announced Uncle Robert,
handing forward a very, very shy little girl.</p>

<p>“Her father is an industrious plumber,” explained
Aunt Louise in Miss Cissy’s ear. “But his wife died
last fall, and the children have no one to look out for
them while he is at work.”</p>

<p>Poor Rosy was frightfully alarmed. She set up a
violent crying at once, shedding the biggest tears
Polly had ever seen, and it took all Miss Cissy’s tact
to comfort her.</p>

<p>In the meantime a lady and gentleman called
“Aunt Edith” and “Uncle Elliot,” had brought up
another little girl whose hair was as black as Polly’s
boots, and whose eyes almost snapped with mischief.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Elsie Blair, and she lives at our
beautiful Home for Friend&mdash;for Children,” explained
Aunt Edith. “Mrs. McAdams, the matron, says Elsie
is an excellent child.”</p>

<p>“Now, father and mother,” said Miss Cicely, clasping
Rosy Hartigan with one hand, and patting the
excellent Elsie into line with the other.</p>

<p>“Father” and “Mother,” it appeared, had brought
Miss Sarah Findlay, who was twelve, and tall for her
age. She was very thin, with not much hair to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of, and no eyebrows at all. Miss Sarah came from
the country and her father was a minister. “She had
twelve brothers and sisters,” she confided to Polly.</p>

<p>“Now, I think we have all our party collected
together,” said Miss Cissy cheerfully. “Suppose we
play London Bridge. Come, Polly and Katie and
Angeline! Come, Elsie and Sarah and Rosy! Join
hands! Now sing! ‘London Bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down!’”</p>

<p>No one but Miss Cicely could possibly have managed
to make those six little girls feel so at home and
so well-acquainted with one another in so short a time.
By the end of “London Bridge” they felt as if they
had been friends all their lives. Then followed
“Oats, peas, beans and barley grows,” and “Drop
the handkerchief,” and in all the excitement Polly
had no time to wonder where Priscilla was and why
she did not come to her own party. After a while
Miss Cissy sat down at the piano and played a gay
march and then the company was invited out to
supper.</p>

<p>Polly and Sarah walked together; Katie Schorr and
Angeline Montague made a second couple and Rosy
Hartigan and Elsie Blair brought up the rear.</p>

<p>“It’s going off surprisingly well,” remarked Aunt
Laura, as the procession filed out into the hall.
“They all seem decent children, but of the lot I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
prefer Angeline Montague. She has such superior
manners. After her I should select Cicely’s Polly
What’s-her-name.”</p>

<p>“Don’t whistle before you are out of the woods,
my dear,” cautioned Uncle Arthur. “The party
isn’t over yet.”</p>

<p>In the dining-room the children were reveling in
good things to eat. Dainty chicken sandwiches;
salad that made one’s mouth water; jelly and cake
and candied fruit; bonbons and ice cream, and
chocolate served in tall, slender cups, with whipped
cream on top, and wee silver spoons in the saucers&mdash;spoons
that looked as if they were intended for the
daintiest of dolls.</p>

<p>“Gorry!” whispered Katie Schorr to Angeline
Montague, “isn’t this fine?”</p>

<p>Uncle Arthur, standing in the doorway behind a
heavy hanging, took a note-book out of his pocket
and jotted something down in it.</p>

<p>At first there was not much chatter. The children
were too busy for that, but by and by their tongues
were loosened and then, how they did talk!</p>

<p>Rosy Hartigan became so brave that she actually
consented to spell her name as the teacher in her
school had taught her to do: “R-o, Ro, s-y, sy, Rosy;
H-a-r, Har; syHar; RosyHar; T-i, ti; Harti; syHarti;
RosyHarti; G-a-n, Gan; tigan; Hartigan; syHartigan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Rosy Hartigan!” At which Miss Cissy clapped
her hands and cried: “Good!” but Elsie Blair whispered
“Smarty!” in Rosy’s left ear.</p>

<p>Sarah Findlay, fired by Rosy’s success, said her
brothers “Knew lots and lots of tricks. They had
taught her to make the awfullest cross-eyed face in
the world and she’d do it for them if they wanted her
to. You just had to pull your mouth down at the
corners with your two fingers, like this and then look
cross eyed, like this and then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Uncle Arthur took out his note-book again and
wrote down something in it, though no one saw him
do it.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rosy Hartigan gave a piercing shriek and
Miss Cissy hurried to her in distress, asking what the
trouble was. It seemed that Rosy’s left arm had
been most terribly pinched, so that it “hurt like
everything,” but when Elsie Blair, who sat on that
side of Rosy, was asked if she had pinched her arm,
she protested “No, she hadn’t, and if Rosy went and
said she had, Rosy was nothing but an old story&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Miss Cicely’s gentle hand over her lips
smothered the rest of the word and, Rosy being
comforted, supper went merrily on. At last, when
nobody could possibly eat another mouthful, Miss
Cissy said they would all go back into the drawing-room
and have more games. So back they went and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
played “Hunt the slipper” and “A tisket, a tasket”
and then a big bag was brought in and they all
“grabbed” for presents. After that it was time to
go home, but Uncle Arthur insisted on one more
game and chose “Forfeits,” which was “the loveliest
fun” in the world, for when Miss Cicely held the
forfeits over his head he invented the funniest things
you ever heard of that the owner must do to redeem
them.</p>

<p>Katie Schorr was to take what Miss Cissy gave her
without moving a muscle of her face or saying a
word, and how could any little girl be expected to
succeed in doing such an impossible thing as that
when what Miss Cissy gave her was a perfectly
darling doll all dressed in blue, which she was to keep
for her very own? Why, Katie’s mouth danced right
up at the corners and she said “O goody!” before
she knew it.</p>

<p>Rosy Hartigan had to spell her name before all the
grand ladies and gentlemen (which almost frightened
her out of her wits) but she did it and then she got
a doll just like Katie’s, only hers was dressed in pink.</p>

<p>Next, Elsie Blair had to “guess” who had pinched
Rosy during supper and if she guessed wrong she was
to have no doll. So Elsie, very red and shamefaced,
guessed right immediately; she “guessed she did it
herself” and then she received a doll dressed in red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah Findlay won her prize by “crossing her
heart and promising sure and true, black and blue,”
she’d never make her cross-eyed face any more, for
Uncle Arthur had known a little girl once who had
crossed her eyes just so, in fun, and when she tried
she couldn’t get them straight again.</p>

<p>Polly had to tell them all what she wanted most in
the whole world, but if Uncle Arthur thought it
would be difficult for her to decide, he was mistaken.
It did not take her an instant to say: “To have sister
get well.” Then she got her doll&mdash;and a pat on the
head from Uncle Arthur, as well.</p>

<p>But the most curious penalty of all came last.
Angeline Montague was to give Miss Cicely what she
had in her pocket and no one need ask what it was,
for they should never know. So Angeline, very pale
and trembling, and after fumbling in her pocket for
an instant brought out something which she handed
Miss Cissy behind the folds of her dress. Miss Cissy
took it with a look so sad and grieved that Polly
could have cried to see her. She bent down and
whispered a secret in Angeline’s ear and then gave
her her doll. That ended the game. They all joined
in singing “America” and then the party was over.</p>

<p>While they were up-stairs getting ready to go home
the grown-up people were very busy in the drawing-room
below. Grandpapa and Grandmamma Duer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were sorry Miss Katie Schorr had said, “Gorry!” as,
of course, Priscilla’s playmate must be a little lady and
ladies do not say “Gorry,” or words like that. Uncle
Robert and Aunt Louise thought Rosy Hartigan was
a good little girl, but something of a cry-baby and a
telltale. Uncle Elliot and Aunt Edith said they
could not dream of having Priscilla associate with a
child like Elsie Blair who did not tell the truth until
she was compelled. Miss Cicely’s father and mother
felt that Sarah Findlay’s brothers had taught her
more tricks than were necessary to complete Priscilla’s
education, so the choice finally lay between
Polly Carter and Angeline Montague.</p>

<p>Aunt Laura liked Polly well enough and agreed
with the rest that she seemed an unaffected, honest
little creature, but it was easy to see that Angeline’s
pretty face and beautiful manners had bewitched her
as well as the other ladies and that if Miss Cissy had
no objection Angeline would be chosen for the place
of honor. Miss Cissy was in the dressing-room overseeing
the putting on of the children’s hats and wraps
and saying good-bye to them before they were taken
home. Uncle Arthur said it would be unfair not to
wait for her to come down before finally deciding on
Angeline. She had been the one to suggest a playmate
for Priscilla and he thought she had the best
right, next to Uncle Elliot and Aunt Edith, Priscilla’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
father and mother, to decide who the playmate should
be. Aunt Laura was willing, of course to wait for
Cicely, but the more she thought of it the better she
was pleased with the idea of Angeline for Priscilla’s
companion.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Cissy came down. She listened
patiently to everything every one had to say about the
children, and she gave particular attention to Aunt
Laura’s claim for Angeline, looking so sober meanwhile
that her relations were quite sorry for her, for
though she did not say a word in Polly’s favor, they
gathered that she liked the little girl and was disappointed
because Angeline had proved first-choice.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” concluded Aunt Laura briskly, “I
suppose we can call it settled that Angeline is to be
the one. I’m a pretty good judge of children and
from the first I took to her. Your little Polly
What’s-her-name is all right, Cicely. I haven’t a word
to say against her and if Angeline were not there I
should certainly choose her, but, under the circumstances,
I think there can be no doubt that Angeline
is the child for the place.”</p>

<p>Miss Cissy said nothing. For a moment there was
silence. Then Uncle Arthur inquired politely:</p>

<p>“Have any of you ever heard it suggested that appearances
are sometimes supposed to be deceitful?”</p>

<p>They all had heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Arthur nodded. “Very well. Now, have
any of you ever heard it mentioned that all is not
gold that glitters?”</p>

<p>Aunt Laura broke in with a “Don’t be absurd,
Arthur,” but her husband continued without noticing
the interruption, “Or that handsome is as handsome
does? Good! I see you have. Now, it appears
there is still another proverb for you to learn which
evidently Laura’s young friend, Miss Angeline, believes
to be true and which is that a broken chocolate
cup in the pocket is worth two in the saucer.”</p>

<p>Uncle Arthur paused. In a flash there broke out a
quick chorus of questions.</p>

<p>“Arthur, what do you mean?” from Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please explain?” from Uncle Elliot.</p>

<p>And “Is it a joke?” “What is the point?” and
“How do you know?” from the rest.</p>

<p>Uncle Arthur waited a moment until the flurry was
past. Then he said in a very serious voice and one
that was not at all trifling: “I mean, simply, that
Miss Angeline Montague is very pretty to look at and
that her manners are charming and that it is the
greatest of pities that she is not so nice a little girl as
she appears to be, but the truth is&mdash;I hate to say it&mdash;but
the truth is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what? Do hurry, please!” urged Aunt
Laura.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Cissy drew something out of her handkerchief,
and held it in her outstretched palm for them all to
see. It was one of Aunt Edith’s pretty chocolate
cups broken into fragments.</p>

<p>“Poor little Angeline did it,” she explained sadly.
“No one but Uncle Arthur saw the accident and there
would have been no great harm done if Angeline had
not turned coward and tried to place the blame on
some one else. Uncle Arthur watched her closely and
saw her slip Polly’s cup off its saucer and put it upon
her own. You see, her idea was to have the blame
laid on Polly if the accident were discovered and her
plan would have succeeded if it had not been for
Uncle Arthur, for James missed the cup at once and
came and told me that it was gone from the saucer of
the little girl I had brought. I was glad to be able
to say she was not responsible for it and that Mr.
Hamilton knew who was.”</p>

<p>Tears were in Miss Cissy’s eyes as she finished, and
Uncle Arthur looked so grieved that Aunt Laura rose
and went to him to give his arm a comforting pat.
She knew that honorable people never “tell on” other
people unless they must and when they have to, it
hurts them sadly, so she felt very sorry for Uncle
Arthur and for Miss Cicely too, and last and most of
all, for Angeline.</p>

<p>So that was how it came about that when the choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of Priscilla’s playmate was put to vote Polly was
“unanimously elected.”</p>

<p>Miss Cissy hummed happily to herself as she ran
up-stairs to hug and kiss Cash one-hundred-and-five
and explain to her that sister had given her permission
to make Priscilla a long, long visit and that she
was to begin it right off.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">“SWEET P’S”</span></h2>

<p>Up-stairs in the nursery the lamps were lit and a
bright fire glowed on the hearth. Hannah was bustling
about in her own busy fashion and Priscilla lay
cuddled up in the big sleepy-hollow chair with a picture-book
in her lap. It was all very quiet and cozy
and Little Boy Blue and Mary, Mary Quite Contrary
and the rest of the dear Mother Goose people who
looked out from their places in the dainty wall-paper,
seemed to nod and wink at Priscilla as if they were
glad it was their good fortune to be here.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantel-shelf chimed six.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s keeping James with your supper,”
murmured Hannah comfortably. “He’s generally
prompt at the stroke o’ six but to-night&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
there he is now!”</p>

<p>Priscilla did not look up from her book as the door-knob
turned. She was not hungry and the prospect
of James carrying a tray spread with nice things to
eat was too familiar to interest her. Poor little
Priscilla did not know it, but she was really pining
for a change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened, swung wide upon its hinges and
there, on the threshold, stood Miss Cissy clasping a
little stranger-girl by the hand. Hannah gave a
quick exclamation and Priscilla raised her eyes. The
next moment she was in Miss Cissy’s arms.</p>

<p>The little stranger-girl stood by and smiled, while
Simple Simon and Miss Muffet, in the wall-paper,
quite grinned at each other with satisfaction. It
seemed to Polly as if she had stepped right into the
middle of a fairy-tale, for surely never was there so
wonderful a place as this outside of fairy-land, nor a
little princess who was half so fine and delicate.</p>

<p>Miss Cissy beckoned her to come forward saying
gaily:</p>

<p>“See, Priscilla, I have brought you a visitor. This
is Polly Carter. Won’t you shake hands with her,
dear?”</p>

<p>Priscilla shyly put out a frail, soft little hand which
Polly grasped in her thin, little chapped one.</p>

<p>“Polly is going to stay all night,” went on Miss
Cicely, “and if she has a good time and enjoys herself,
and if you get on nicely and like each other, she won’t
go home for a while. They will put up a bed for her
in your room, right across the way from yours and
you can chatter to each other in the morning and be
as jolly as you like. Just think what fun it’s going to
be, Priscilla! Why, you can have breakfast-parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and dinner-parties and tea-parties together every day
at your little table, all by yourselves, and you can
show Polly your toys and she can show you new ways
of playing with them, and you can keep house and
visit and have&mdash;oh! lots of good times! And perhaps,
if I’m very good, you’ll let me come and join in
the sport sometimes, for I think I like your kind of
play better than the sort they have down-stairs&mdash;I
mean, the grown-up people. I wouldn’t tell anybody
but you, of course, but it’s sometimes a little&mdash;just
a little dull down there. But up here! dear me!
why there’s no end to the sport you can have up here,
if you want to. I don’t believe Polly ever saw anything
so funny in all her life as your walking-doll was
the other night, Priscilla, when you dropped her on
the floor and she lay there on her back, sawing the
air with her arms, and kicking.”</p>

<p>Priscilla smiled demurely and drew herself from
Miss Cissy’s arm. “I’ll get her now,” she volunteered
in a timid whisper. “If you wind her up and put her
on the floor she’ll do it again.”</p>

<p>How Polly did laugh to see the fine French lady in
such an awkward predicament and seeming to be so
indignant about it! Her merry giggle was so irresistible
that Priscilla, after a moment, joined in with
a soft little chuckle on her own account. Then a
music-box was brought out and the Parisian Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was set upon her feet and made to walk to its
tune. It appeared she could not keep step at all,
though at first she flew about very fast trying to do
so, but by and by she got discouraged and walked
slower and slower, until, at last, she collapsed entirely
and fell on the floor with a final wriggle of despair, as
if she gave it up as a bad job. Polly’s giggle broke
into a laughing shout at this and James, coming in
with a huge tray in his arms, almost stumbled over in
amazement at the unaccustomed sight and sound of
such merriment in the usually quiet nursery.</p>

<p>Priscilla discovered that supper was a very different
affair when one did not have to sit and eat it alone.
When Hannah served her and Polly to the bread and
butter they bit into their slices and compared the impressions
made by their teeth. Polly’s arch was wide
and shallow with a little uneven place in the centre
where one of her front teeth lapped a trifle, and
Priscilla’s was narrower but quite exact all around.
By biting carefully on one side and another of this
first shape they found they could make different
figures, new patterns being disclosed by each nibble, a
fact which was so amusing that though Priscilla had
not been hungry and Polly had thought she had had as
much as she could possibly eat down-stairs, they
managed to dispose of several slices before they were
aware. Hannah shook her head at such “bad table-manners”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
but Miss Cissy would not have the children
disturbed “just for once.” They sipped their creamy
milk and ate their fruit and, what she said she used to
call “good-for-you pudding” when she was a little
girl, with as much relish as if neither of them had
tasted a mouthful since morning, and by the end of
the meal Polly had told Priscilla about sister and
Priscilla had confided to Polly that she did not like to
have her hair combed “’cause it pulled so and hurt
most aw’fly.”</p>

<p>“That’s ’cause it’s so fine and curly,” explained
Polly. “Mine is straight and the tangles come out
easy, but I’d rather have yours if I were you. Yours
looks like fine silk&mdash;the kind ladies buy at the embroidery
counter to do fancy-work with. Floss,
that’s what they call it. Your hair is just like
floss.”</p>

<p>Since Polly appeared to think it was nice to have
hair like floss Priscilla felt it might be easier to bear
the pulling of the comb. At any rate she made up
her mind, then and there, that she would be “as brave
as a soldier” after that and show Polly how she could
bear pain without a whimper.</p>

<p>Miss Cicely stayed until the supper-table was cleared
and the two Sweet P’s, as she called them, were contentedly
cutting out paper dolls in the light of the
lamp, and then she slipped quietly away down-stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to join the rest of the family, who were going in to
dinner.</p>

<p>Polly passed the evening in a sort of happy dream
of delight. The warmth of the cheerful fire, its soft
light and the pleasant coziness of the room, were so
different from anything she had ever known before
that she felt she would certainly wake up, in a minute
or so and find it all vanished and herself back in the
little room down-town, where the kerosene lamp gave
out a sickening odor, and the fire in the stove couldn’t
be kept burning after supper was prepared because coal
was so high this winter. The wind came in through
the chinks of the windows and door in chilling gusts,
and even when one cuddled up in bed under the blankets
and snuggled next to sister, one hardly got
warmed through before morning. And then, to have
to get up before it was light, and go shivering about
in the dark, groping around blind with sleep, and
have to hurry out into the icy, wintry streets to a
weary day of cash-running at the store! She was so
full of her own thoughts that her scissors had almost
snipped the head off the splendid paper lady she was
cutting out before she knew it, and Priscilla seeing the
narrow escape, gave a little low exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re pretty tired, aren’t you?” Hannah
asked kindly, coming and standing beside her chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and looking down at her benevolently. Polly nodded,
but could not answer in words. The memory of the
cold, bare little down-town room had awakened another
memory: the memory of sister, and all at once
her heart sickened of the warmth and comfort and
light here and just turned hungrily to the poorer place
where sister was, in longing to go back.</p>

<p>“Come, you two little ladies, it’s time for bed,”
cried Hannah briskly. “Now, which one can get her
clothes off first? I warrant I know.”</p>

<p>Poor little Priscilla tugged and wrenched in vain;
she was not accustomed to do for herself, and Polly
stood undressed and clad in her “nightie” before she
even had her slippers untied. At sight of her disappointed
little face Hannah caught her up in her arms
and gave her a good hug, and the next moment all her
buttons were unfastened as if by magic. It was an
old story to Priscilla to sit before the fire wrapped in
her downy bath-robe and have her hair brushed and
braided for the night, while Hannah told her stories
of kings and queens or repeated the exciting history
of “The Little Schmall Rid Hin.” But to Polly it
was a new and curious experience which made her
forget for the moment the strange, sickening ache
in her heart. She thrust her feet out toward the
pleasant fire-glow and laughed approvingly when the
fox, having planned to “git the little schmall rid hin”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>

fooled by the wonderful biddy and, with his wicked

<p class="noindent">Priscilla’s head was fairly nodding by the time
prayers were said and Hannah ready to carry her off
to bed and tuck her in. But long after she was
breathing softly on her pillow, Polly lay awake and
thought and thought and thought of sister in her
loneliness, at home in the cold and dark, until, at
length, she could bear it no longer and the tears came
in a flood, quite drenching the fine, embroidered handkerchief
Miss Cissy had given her and of whose new
crispness she had been so proud.</p>

<p>In a moment Hannah was at her side.</p>

<p>“What is it, honey? Tell Hannah,” she urged
very tenderly, as she knelt down and slid her arm
under Polly’s head. Then it all came out: about the
dreadful ache and longing in her heart and the choking
in her throat.</p>

<p>“Why, bless you, you’re homesick and so you are,”
explained Priscilla’s nurse encouragingly. “And no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wonder at all&mdash;not the least in the world. Lots of
folks are homesick and they get over it in no time at
all, if they just make up their minds to it. Why,
think of me! I came over,&mdash;away from my father
and mother, across the wide sea, when I was but a
slip of a girl, not seven years older than you. And
think of the gain that’ll come to your sister if you are
good and contented here. Why, the hospital doctors
will look at her and they’ll say: ‘Now, here is a
young woman we must certainly manage to cure
whether or not for Miss Cicely Duer says so.’ And
the nurses will say the same thing. And they’ll give
her a room all to herself with sun coming in at the
windows, and there’ll be flowers on the bureau that
Miss Cicely and Priscilla’s mamma will send. And
her bed will be all soft and white, and the nurses will
have on white caps and aprons and cuffs, just spick
and spandy and they’ll give her lovely things to eat
and then&mdash;and then&mdash;before you know it almost,
sister will be well and walking around as fine as can
be. And that will be your doing if you’re a good
girl and don’t get mopey and homesick.”</p>

<p>Polly’s eyes were quite dry by the time Hannah
paused to take breath. The picture of sister in such
pleasant surroundings almost reconciled her to her
own good fortune. She saw the sunlight coming in
at the windows and the flowers nodding on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
bureau and the white-capped nurses hovering round
and then, by and by, Hannah’s voice seemed to melt
into a gentle drone&mdash;the drone of a sleepy fly bobbing
against sister’s hospital-room window in the sunlight
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Polly opened her eyes to see the sunlight really
slanting in at the window of the pretty bedroom in
which she and Priscilla had slept. For a moment she
lay still, trying to remember where she was and how
she came to be in this splendid gold bed, between
soft, fleecy blankets and smooth linen. There was
another bed just like her own standing against the
wall across the room&mdash;but the other bed was empty.
Then it all came back to her. Priscilla had slept in
that other bed. Where was Priscilla?</p>

<p>A sound of splashing and running water seemed to
answer her and in another moment Hannah appeared
carrying Priscilla wrapped in bath-sheets, fresh from
her morning tub.</p>

<p>“Just wait a moment till I have Priscilla dry and
then in you go,” threatened Hannah with a pretended
frown.</p>

<p>But Polly was not in the least alarmed. She reveled
in the warm water and plunged about in the
white tub as energetically as if she had been a canary
taking a morning dip in a china dish. Then she and
Priscilla had breakfast in the nursery, with Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Pumpkin-Eater and Jack Sprat-Could-Eat-No-Fat
looking down at them from the walls and probably
wishing they had such delicious milk-toast and cream-of-wheat
and poached eggs to feast upon.</p>

<p>Priscilla’s mother came to visit them soon after the
meal was over and she proved so sweet and beautiful
a lady that Polly felt there was only one person in
the whole world who was more wonderful than she
and that Miss Cicely was that one. She talked to
Priscilla and Polly for a long time and seemed sorry
when some one&mdash;the haughty Theresa&mdash;came to
summon her down-stairs and she had to leave
them.</p>

<p>Then hats and coats were brought out and the
Sweet P’s made ready for a walk. There was not
much fun in pacing slowly up the avenue and around
the windy paths of the Park. Before they had gone
three blocks Polly was stiff and chilly and poor little
Priscilla was having the cold shivers inside her fur
coat.</p>

<p>“Let’s play las’-tag,” suggested Polly. “Then we
can run, and running makes you warm. Why, I used
to get as hot as anything at the store, just with
running.”</p>

<p>“What’s las’-tag?” asked Priscilla listlessly.</p>

<p>Polly explained. “And I’ll be ‘It’ if you like,” she
said. “Now, you run and I’ll try to catch you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Hannah’ll be ‘Hunk.’ One, two, three! Off goes
she!”</p>

<p>In no time at all they were both in a glow, their
cheeks ruddy and tingling with warmth and their
eyes sparkling with fun. Priscilla was delighted and
she and Polly las’-tagged each other merrily all the
way home. Certainly the hated morning walk was
going to be a different affair after this. James could
hardly believe his eyes at the change he saw in Priscilla’s
appearance when he opened the door to them
at one o’clock.</p>

<p>“Why, she looks like another child,” he said to
Theresa who was passing through the hall.</p>

<p>Theresa curled her lip.</p>

<p>“You and Hannah may do as you like,” she snapped
pettishly, “but nobody’ll get me to wait on any
beggar-child&mdash;not if I know it. Why couldn’t they
have taken that sweet little Angeline Montague, if
they must have some one, and not given the place to a
common little thing like this Polly-one. I know
Angeline’s mother well. I got her the job at Mrs.
Hamilton’s and she’s a lady,&mdash;I tell you. And Angeline
herself is a little angel! Who knows anything
about this child they have taken in?” and Theresa
tossed her head spitefully.</p>

<p>James pursed his lips as if he were going to whistle.
“I don’t know anything about her, that’s certain,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
admitted, “and if you don’t either, Theresa, why, I
guess there ain’t any call for you to clap names on
her like what you’ve done. After all, she ain’t harming
you. Fair play is a jewel. If she don’t interfere
with you, you don’t need to interfere with her!”</p>

<p>“Interfere with me!” cried Theresa hotly. “Much
you know about it, James Craig. That’s just what
she has done, with a vengeance!”</p>

<p>James shrugged his shoulders. “Why, I don’t see
what concern it is of yours, if the family chooses to
get a companion for Miss Priscilla. You ain’t got to
pay for her board and keep.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ain’t,” returned Theresa with added
sharpness, “but perhaps, on the other hand, I got to
pay for the board and keep of somebody else, that she
has done out of a rare chance.”</p>

<p>The butler’s eyes opened wide. “You don’t mean
to say&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to say nothing,” the maid retorted
quickly. “I just ain’t going to do anything that’s
outside my work, that’s all. I respect myself too
much to lay a hand to anything I didn’t engage for,
and if you and Hannah choose to fetch and carry for
strangers from no-one-knows-where, you can do it and
welcome! But the more sillies you, that’s all!”</p>

<p>The good-natured James watched the irate woman
as she flounced up-stairs and then drew in his breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with a long whistling sound. He thought Theresa
was “a terror” and he made up his mind then and
there that he would “steer clear of her” in the
future.</p>

<p>In the meantime Polly, who was quite unconscious
of having given offense to any one in the world and
who felt at peace with all men, was astonished and
dismayed, as the days went by, to find that Theresa
did not like her. At first she did not realize that
anything was amiss. The maid seemed to her a very
haughty lady whose manners were proud and overbearing
to be sure, and not at all gentle and sweet as
Priscilla’s mother’s and Miss Cicely’s were, but who
was probably, nevertheless, good and kind at heart,
like all the rest of the world. Once or twice she
brushed roughly against Polly in the halls, but Polly
said, “Excuse me,” as sister had taught her to do
when she got in any one’s way, and then thought no
more about it.</p>

<p>Then, another time, Polly was going down-stairs on
an errand for Hannah and just as she reached the
second flight Theresa came out of the sitting-room
and began to busy herself dusting the top of the baluster-rail.
Polly said, “Good-morning!” as politely
as she could, but Theresa did not appear to hear her
and the next minute Polly’s dress had caught in a
nail or something, it could not have been Theresa’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hand, of course, and she was crashing down-stairs,
heels over head, bumpety-bump! as hard as she could
go. She was so badly frightened that it took her
some time to recover herself, but her bruises were not
serious and James brought a chocolate spice-cake out
of the butler’s pantry, which he said he would give
her if she did not cry any more. So she dried her
tears and promised she would “look where she
walked” after that and was happy again in no time
at all.</p>

<p>But before she went up-stairs James whispered in
her ear: “Say, I wouldn’t get in Theresa’s way, if I
were you. Theresa is&mdash;er&mdash;nervous and little girls
bother her, I guess, and it’s always better when folks
is like that to keep yourself to yourself. See?”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">POLLY’S PLUCK</span></h2>

<p>Angeline Montague did not tell her mother the
forfeit she had had to pay to “redeem” the beautiful
doll she had brought home from Miss Cicely’s party.
In the first place, she conveniently forgot it, and in
the second, she always made a point of keeping very
still when her mother was in a “tantrum,” and her
mother was in a terrible one that day. Something
had gone wrong somewhere, for the moment Angeline
reached home her mother had caught her by the arm
and swung her about roughly, saying: “Ho! So
here you are, are you? Then you didn’t get it, did
you? And after all the trouble I went to, to teach
you how to bow and to hold your tongue and to speak
soft and genteel when you did speak! And the money
I spent on your clothes, too! I’ve half a mind to beat
you well, you great silly. What under the sun your
Aunt Theresa’ll do to you, I don’t know&mdash;like as not
she’ll put you in jail or send you to the reform-school
or something. I do declare I never saw such a numb-scull!
Where’s your brains, I’d like to know, to let any
one else get ahead of you like that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Angeline sobbed.</p>

<p>“There now,” continued her mother less harshly.
“Quit that, and take off those togs you’ve got on. It
makes me just wild to see ’em and think what they
cost, and then what a fool you were to let such a
chance slip through your fingers.”</p>

<p>Angeline sobbed still more piteously. She knew it
was the only way to disarm her mother. After a
minute or two the angry woman said: “Hush, hush,
I tell you, Angeline, or the neighbors’ll think I’m killing
you&mdash;and they have enough to say about us
already. Besides, you’d better save your tears till
your Aunt Theresa comes, for you’ll need ’em then,
or I’m mistaken. She ain’t as easy as I am, not by a
long sight, and she’ll scold the life out of us both for
your foolishness. She’ll probably stop paying for your
board and keep into the bargain, and then what’ll become
of us, I don’t see. We’ll be turned out into the
street, most likely, for I’m two weeks behind with the
rent as it is, and goodness knows where I’ll get the
money to pay up.”</p>

<p>Angeline’s sobs grew softer. “I did the best I
could,” she whimpered. “I never told a livin’ soul
my name ain’t Montague or that Aunt Theresa is my
aunt, an’ I bowed just like you tol’ me to, an’ I didn’t
hardly say annything to annyboddy. I just smiled the
way you showed me, as soft as ever I could, an’ Mis’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Hamilton she said I was a sweet little thing. I
listened an’ I heard her. I didn’t let noboddy get
ahead of me nor nothing. I got the best cakes an’
the biggest orange an’&mdash;an’&mdash;I would have got a&mdash;other
things too, but a big man, he was real mean and
kept looking!”</p>

<p>“Well, go ’long with you now,” said her mother,
whose true name was McGaffey. “Take off those
duds or you’ll tear ’em or something an’ then the fat
will be in the fire.”</p>

<p>Later that evening when Angeline was in bed her
mother had a visitor. It was Theresa, and her angry
voice made the little girl quail. She knew Aunt
Theresa well and dreaded her, so she pretended to be
asleep when her bedroom door was rudely flung open
and quick steps came toward her where she lay.</p>

<p>“Get up, you Angeline,” ordered Theresa, clutching
her by the arm. “You ain’t asleep, I know your
tricks. Get up this minute, I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>The child came shivering into the outer room.</p>

<p>“Now tell me this minute,” commanded her aunt,
“every single thing that happened this afternoon at
my house. Don’t you leave out anything, and don’t
you tell me a falsehood, or it’ll be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>So the wretched Angeline, shaking with cold and
sobbing from fright, confessed to the affair of the
broken chocolate-cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“There! What did I tell you,” demanded Theresa
of Mrs. McGaffey when the story was done. “I knew
there was something wrong somewhere, or she’d have
gotten the place, sure as preaching. Her tricks will be
the ruin of us all before she’s through, I tell you,
Harriet. She ought to be beat, that’s what ought to
be done to her. She’s a bad child, right through.
Why, Mrs. Hamilton as good as told me the whole
thing was settled and Angeline was to go straight up
to the nursery then and there, and you was to get sixteen
dollars a month for the loan of her. The young
un that’s there now is nothing to look at&mdash;nothing
next to Angeline, but she got the place because she
hasn’t underhand ways and doesn’t try to make other
people suffer for her faults. But I’ll pay her off before
I’m through with her, never you fear. In the
meantime if I could just punish this child here for her
foolishness, it’d do me a world of good. Now go
back to bed, you Angeline McGaffey, and if I ever
catch you deceiving again and running your mother
and me into danger of being disgraced, I’ll attend to
you, rest assured of that.”</p>

<p>Angeline crept off to her room, greatly relieved that
she had escaped so easily at the hands of her vixenish
aunt. She was accustomed by this time, to loud and
angry talking, and did not let herself be much disturbed
by it. In a very little while, therefore, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
long before her Aunt Theresa had gone, she was
asleep and dreaming, and the next day she had forgotten
all about it. But Theresa did not forget. She had
told her sister that she meant to bide her time and
wait her chance, but that in the end she’d get even
with Polly for having cut Angelina out, as she expressed
it, and she intended to keep her word.</p>

<p>After her tumble down-stairs, and the whispered
warning James had given her, Polly managed to
avoid Theresa. It was not very difficult to do this,
for the children spent most of their time in the open
air or in the nursery. The cold and stupid morning
walks that Priscilla had used to dread, she now looked
forward to with pleasure, and her skin and eyes were
beginning to show the difference. Miss Cissy’s plan
was working like a charm&mdash;there could be no doubt
about that.</p>

<p>Priscilla, in her quiet, shy little way, had grown to
love Polly dearly, and as for Polly, why, she simply
adored Priscilla, and would have done anything in
the world for her. She “gave up” so entirely in fact,
that Hannah often had to interfere to save Priscilla
from becoming selfish through too much indulgence.
When they played house, Polly was always the baby
and Priscilla the mother; when they played school,
Polly was the scholar and Priscilla the teacher. In
las’-tag, Polly was “It,” no matter how often she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
caught Priscilla, and when Hannah shook her finger
at her, she was sure to whisper: “She’s so little, you
know. She can’t run as fast as I can, and it isn’t
fair. ’Sides, she likes to think she’s beating. When
she las’-tags me she laughs right out loud, she’s so
pleased.”</p>

<p>“Well, you mustn’t spoil her, that’s all,” warned
Hannah, but she confided to James on more than one
occasion that, “that Polly’s a caution. I never saw
her equal. She don’t know what it means to think of
herself. And the grown-up way she’s got with her,
of looking out for Priscilla! Why, you’d think she’d
been used to protecting some one all her life.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps she has,” suggested James, thoughtfully.
“How about that crippled sister of hers.
Ain’t she had to protect her? An experience like
that puts years on a young thing’s age. By the way,
how is the sister?”</p>

<p>Hannah shook her head. “It’s a bad case the doctors
think, so Miss Cicely and Mrs. Duer tell me. If
it had been properly attended to in the first place, it
would be different, but the poor thing was neglected
and now it may be too late. We don’t dare tell the
child, for her heart is bound up in her sister, and she’s
set on her getting well. The two of them were all
run down, what with not having enough food to
nourish ’em, and perishin’ with the cold last winter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
account of no coal, and that tells against the girl’s
getting well. She has nothing to bear up on. See
now, she’s been at the hospital ever since the week
after Priscilla’s birthday, that was the first part of
February, and now it’s the last of March. But we
don’t give up hope. The doctors say she may possibly
get to walk again&mdash;only it’ll take a long time, and
she’ll have to go through a lot before it happens, if it
ever does. She’ll be at the hospital all summer anyhow,
and maybe longer. But it’s true, what you say
about her being the cause of Polly’s acting old for
her years, and having such motherly ways. Poor
little creature! She’s actually getting a bit of flesh
on her bones, as well as Priscilla, and I declare she’s
as pretty as a picture sometimes. I told Mrs. Duer
the other day, I was never afraid for Priscilla when
Polly was around. She’d just let herself be cut into
small pieces before she’d see a hair of Priscilla’s head
harmed.”</p>

<p>“She’s got good pluck, I know that,” answered
James, thinking of Theresa, and Polly’s fall down-stairs.</p>

<p>Polly had occasion to prove her “pluck” within the
course of the next few days.</p>

<p>The children had had their regular romp in the
Park one morning and were ready to go home, when
Hannah bethought herself of a few little sewing odds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and ends that she sorely needed. She made up her
mind she would buy them on the way back. It would
take her but a few blocks out of her way, and the
children would not mind the little extra walk, especially
as it was on the fascinating, forbidden ground
of the bustling avenue, where so many shops and
clanging cable-cars were.</p>

<p>Poor Polly, who had been perfectly used to shifting
for herself amid crowds, was greatly amused at Hannah’s
command that she “mustn’t let go her hand one
minute,” but she did as she was bade, and clung to
the nurse’s arm until they reached the shop, where
Hannah’s trifles were to be bought. It was an attractive
place enough, full of bright-colored ribbons
and laces and tinsel and gay embroidery stuffs. There
was, however, nothing very interesting to children,
except in one corner, where was a counter upon which
a number of artistically made rag-dolls were perched.
Priscilla fell in love with these at first sight, and tugged
at Hannah’s skirts, begging her to “come and see.”</p>

<p>Hannah was busy with her own affairs, but she left
them to follow Priscilla and to exclaim, “Why, ain’t
they just splendid, now?” as she knew Priscilla
wanted her to do.</p>

<p>But Priscilla, it seemed, wanted more than this.
“I wish,” she said, in a hesitating, shy murmur: “I
wish I could have one of those dollies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Hannah stared. “Eh? Mercy on us, what next?
Why, what in the world should you want with one of
those dolls, when you have a nurseryful already
at home. And such superior ones, into the bargain,
as these couldn’t hold a candle to. Why, these are
nothing but rag-babies, dearie.”</p>

<p>Priscilla swallowed. “I know it,” she whispered,
with an effort. “But I like them. I wish I could
have one.”</p>

<p>When the little girl spoke in that wistful tone her
nurse could deny her nothing. “Well, if you ain’t
the curiousest child!” she exclaimed. “But if you
want one, why, you want one, and that’s all there is
about it.”</p>

<p>The next moment the pinkest-cheeked rag-baby of
them all was in Priscilla’s arms. She hugged it to
her bosom with a loving clutch she had never given
to any of her French dolls, and Hannah exchanged a
wink with the saleswoman at sight of her satisfaction.</p>

<p>“May I take my dolly into the street? Just to
give her the air?” she asked with motherly solicitude
for her baby’s health.</p>

<p>Hannah nodded. “Yes, if you’ll be sure not to
leave the door-step. Polly, you go with her, like a
good child, and don’t let anything happen to her.
Now, run along, like dearies, and let me do my shoppin’
in peace.”</p>

<p class="caption">“GIVE THAT DOLL BACK THIS MINUTE!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think,” said Priscilla, as she and Polly stood
outside the shop-door, “I think I’ll name this baby
Polly. Then she’ll be part yours, won’t she? ’Sides,
I think the name of Polly is a ’stremely nice name.”</p>

<p>Polly laughed right out with pleasure at the compliment.
“If you name her Polly I’ll be her relation,
won’t I? And I’ll have to give her things and look
after her. Oh, dear me! I wonder what Hannah’ll
say?”</p>

<p>What Hannah would say was never recorded, for
just at this moment a dirty hand thrust itself over
Priscilla’s shoulder and snatched her precious baby
from her arms, while a hoarse voice broke out into a
jeering laugh that almost frightened the children out
of their wits.</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” it cried roughly. “A doll’s relation!
That’s good! The name of Polly is a ’stremely nice
name! Bless me if it ain’t!”</p>

<p>Priscilla’s lips were blue with terror and she but
dimly saw the face of the mischievous newsboy,
as he leered wickedly at her darling doll, pretending
to dance it up and down in his dirty hands.</p>

<p>But Polly’s eyes were blazing. “Give that doll
back this minute!” she broke out in a tremor of indignation.</p>

<p>The newsboy looked at her and grinned. “Oh,
say, now,” he cried. “Who’ll make me? Ain’t I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fond o’ dolls meself? An’ ain’t I got a little sister at
home as just dotes on ’em? W’y, my little sister&mdash;queer
now, ain’t it, but her name’s Polly! a ’stremely
nice name, Polly is! well my sister Polly will just be
tickled out of her boots when I bring her this.”</p>

<p>“You give it back,” stammered Polly, breathless
and panting with anger.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” jeered the young rascal, delighted
to see he was teasing her so successfully, and
clutching the rag-doll more tightly in one arm while
he shifted his bundle of papers in the other.</p>

<p>Polly darted at him; her hand swung out, and
the next moment his ear was tingling from a well-aimed
blow. For an instant he was too amazed to
stir. Then he dropped his papers and the doll together
and made a dash for Polly. She ducked, he
tripped on the shallow door-step and lost his footing.
It was Polly’s chance and she did not lose it. In a
twinkling she had dived for his papers, caught them
up and was flying down the street as fast as her swift
feet would carry her.</p>

<p>“Go in,” she shouted back to Priscilla. “Go in to
Hannah!” Then on she sped like a little whirlwind,
the newsboy after her in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>She knew he must outstrip her in a very few moments,
for he was far older and stronger than she.
Her breath was already coming in painful gasps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
she felt she could not hold out much longer with the
wind blowing against her like this. He was rapidly
gaining. She could hear the clatter of his heavy
boots on the pavement. In a second more he would
have clutched her. Her brain worked like lightning.
She snatched a paper from the bunch in her arm and
flung it into the teeth of the wind, not daring to
pause long enough to look back to see if her pursuer
had stopped to capture it. She dropped another and
another, all the while making toward home, as fast
as she could fly. At length she had only one left,
but she was in sight of the house and Priscilla’s tormentor
was a full block behind. She flung the last
one back with a great sob of relief and then paused a
second to catch her breath and look behind her. The
wind carried the paper straight into the young rascal’s
face. He caught it and hurried on without
losing a second. Polly’s heart almost stopped beating.
It seemed to her as if her feet had grown suddenly
heavy as lead. If she could only reach home!
But she heard those heavy boots stamping nearer and
nearer. Lagging and panting she reached the house
and began to crawl and stumble up the steps scrambling
on all fours, like a baby. The fellow was close
at hand. He could leap the flight, two steps at a
time she knew. She reached the top just as he sprung
to the bottom. Her strength served her to touch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
bell. It faintly rang&mdash;but too faintly to bring James
if he did not happen to be right there. On the instant,
however, the door opened and to the butler’s
amazement Polly stumbled blindly over the threshold
and pitched headlong into the hall.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">SISTER’S PARTY</span></h2>

<p>When Polly opened her eyes the first thing she
saw was James’ kindly face bending over her anxiously.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he said encouragingly.</p>

<p>Polly sat up, feeling faint and dizzy. “What is
it?” she faltered, trying to get upon her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” replied James. “Nothing at
all, in fact. Just, as far as I can make out, you
thought you was the Limited an’ I was Chicago.
You run in on schedule time, and no mistake. Why,
you almost knocked me flat, the way you bolted in
this door.”</p>

<p>His good-natured laugh gave Polly courage.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I hurt you,” she said in a firmer
voice. “I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” returned the kind-hearted
fellow. “I didn’t mind. I’d a got out of your way
if I’d a known this was your busy day and you was in
such a hurry, you know.”</p>

<p>He saw that the little girl was weak and trembling
and though he did not know the cause, he wisely concluded
the best plan was to keep her mind off the
matter as long as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>So he chatted cheerfully on, meanwhile helping her
to rise and guiding her to the dining-room where he
offered her a couple of ladies’-fingers and a glass of
raspberry juice to “sort-of give you an appetite for
your luncheon,” he explained.</p>

<p>But, somehow, Polly’s head had begun to ache and
she felt as if the room were rocking. She did not
want anything to eat, she only wanted to lie down
somewhere and go to sleep. Her eyelids drooped
and her head nodded. James, thinking she might
have had a bad fall, racked his brains for jokes that
would be funny enough to keep her awake and he was
just about to give up in despair when the bell rang
and in came Hannah with Priscilla clinging to her
hand while she clasped a pretty rag-doll to her bosom.
Both were as white as paper. Priscilla was crying
softly. Before James could open his lips Hannah
gasped wildly:</p>

<p>“Polly! Whatever shall I do? She’s running the
streets! She’ll get killed. If he catches her he’ll
beat her, maybe! Oh, dear! the young ruffian! I
was just coming out of the shop when I saw&mdash;&mdash; But
she was off like a shot from a shovel and he after
her. I couldn’t keep up with them, not if I’d been
paid a million dollars for it, and in a minute they
were out of sight. Oh, that poor child! Where is
she now?” and Hannah wrung her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>James looked bewildered as well he might. “I
haven’t the least notion what you’re talking about,”
he said, “but I kind of dimly make out you’re worried
about Polly. Well, you don’t need to be. She’s in
the dining-room, all safe and sound, though a bit unsteady
in the feet and dizzy in the head, by the looks
of her.”</p>

<p>But Hannah had not waited to hear more than the
words that told her Polly was safe. The next instant
she was in the dining room with the little girl gathered
tight in her arms. Polly tried to smile at her
and at Priscilla who was gently patting her arms and
whispering something that no one could hear, but she
dared not keep her eyes open when the room whirled
about so dizzily and Hannah had to call on James to
carry her up-stairs and put her on the nursery lounge.
It was while she was curled up there, sleeping off her
fright and fatigue, with Priscilla sitting on guard beside
her, that Hannah told James what had happened.
She did not mind his frequent interruptions of “Good
girl!” “First-rate!” “Hurrah for Polly!” for she
was as excited over the adventure as he was, and was
glad to have the child appreciated for her part in it.
The story had to be gone over again from beginning
to end for the benefit of Priscilla’s mother and Miss
Cicely and when Polly woke it was to find herself
famous. She was surprised and a little shamefaced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the praise she received. She could not see why they
made so much of her. She had “just made that
naughty boy give back Priscilla’s doll, that was all.
Of course she knew he’d be mad when she boxed his
ears, but a boy was a coward who made a little girl
cry and he ought to be punished. Then, of course,
she ran when he chased her and&mdash;and she snatched
up his papers ’cause somehow, it came into her mind
that if she took them he would forget about Priscilla’s
doll. It was too bad she had scared Hannah. She
would try not to worry her any more.”</p>

<p>Miss Cissy kissed her tenderly and so did Mrs.
Duer, at which Polly felt as if she were a queen who
had just been crowned. And that was the end of the
affair as far as she knew.</p>

<p>Priscilla seemed to be thriving so splendidly that it
was decided to leave the city much earlier than usual
so she could spend the bright spring days entirely out
of doors and get the good of the beautiful country air.</p>

<p>One morning toward the middle of April Hannah
took Polly to the hospital to say good-bye to sister.
Polly had often been there before, but to-day she
found the invalid in a cheerful little sitting-room, with
the sun streaming in at the window and violets and
daffodils upon the table. It was all just as Hannah
had said it would be, even to the white-capped nurses,
“as neat as wax,” bringing sister lovely things to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
eat. Sister had been in bed when Polly was there
before, but now to the little girl’s delight, she found
her sitting up in a wheeled-chair and looking cheerful
and happy in a dainty pink flannel robe with bows of
ribbon on it and lace about the throat and wrists.
Miss Cissy had brought it to her the day before.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re almost well,” cried Polly joyously.</p>

<p>Sister smiled. “It looks like it, doesn’t it?” she
replied and hugged her little visitor to her with a sort
of hungry look in her patient eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll be walking around before I know it
almost,” quoted Polly eagerly, and sister nodded her
head.</p>

<p>“So you are going off into the country,” she said
quickly. “What fun you’ll have and how beautiful it
will be to see the flowers blossoming and to hear the
birds singing. The fields will all be green and there’ll
be dandelions in them and daisies, and you must hunt
for four-leafed clovers. Why, you ought to be the
best girl in the world with so much good coming to
you. She tries to do right, doesn’t she, Hannah? I’m
glad. I knew she would. You’ll remember, won’t
you, Polly, that sister wants you to tell the truth
always; never to tell a falsehood. And you must be
kind and generous to every one and cheerful too.
There’s a little young mother here who has the
cunningest baby! A tiny thing only a few months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
old; and she has made up a song to sing to it that
goes like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Nice little babies never, never cry</div>
<div class="verse">Or when they do, we know the reason why.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Good little babies bravely bear a deal,</div>
<div class="verse">They hold their little heads up</div>
<div class="verse indent1">No matter how they feel.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I want my Polly to ‘hold her little head up, no matter
how she feels,’ for that is the only brave way, you
know.”</p>

<p>Polly felt a lump rising in her throat. “I’ll try,”
she whispered.</p>

<p>Then Hannah brought out a basket packed full of
dainties, which Mrs. Duer had sent, and nothing would
do but they must have a tea-party, to which sister insisted
upon inviting Polly, Hannah, the nurse and the
mother of the “nice little baby.”</p>

<p>While Polly went to carry the invitations Hannah
hurriedly asked, “You are better, though, aren’t you
really? Oh, I hope so, miss.” Sister’s eyes brimmed
with gratitude. “I hope so too,” she said hesitatingly.
“The doctors are giving me a little rest now because
they say I couldn’t stand any more pain for a while.
I tried very hard to be courageous; ‘to bravely bear a
deal,’ you know; ‘to hold my little head up no matter
how I felt,’ but they say I’ll have to rest for a few
weeks. By and by they are going to try again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
then, if my strength holds out, I may really get better.
They say there is a chance&mdash;just think what that
means! a chance that I may be able to walk again!
It makes me too happy!”</p>

<p>Hannah caught up the basket and hid her face behind
the cover, while she pretended to be very busy
taking out the hidden goodies.</p>

<p>Polly thought that it was the jolliest tea-party in the
world, though she, herself, ate hardly anything at all
because she was so occupied with the wonderful mite
of a baby which she was permitted to hold in her own
arms, just as if she had been a grown-up woman. Its
mother seemed to see at once that she was reliable
and could be trusted, and that, in itself, was an honor
to be proud of. The baby, too, seemed to have confidence
in her new nurse, for she smiled and gurgled
and blinked her eyes and did all the dear, ridiculous
things that babies do, and then fell fast asleep in
Polly’s lap, with her little hands clinched tight into
two tiny fists, as if she meant to stand up and fight
anybody who said she wasn’t the biggest and bravest
baby in all the town.</p>

<p>“What’s her name?” whispered Polly at last when
the mite was too sound asleep to be disturbed by her
voice.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t got a name yet,” answered her mother.
“No name seems quite pretty enough. Do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of any name you think would be nice? What is the
loveliest name you know?”</p>

<p>“I know lots,” returned Polly confidently. “There’s
Hannah! Hannah is a fine name. And Ruth! Ruth
is sister’s name. Then I think Edith is just sweet and
Priscilla is most the grandest one I ever heard. But,
I know the one I love the best&mdash;it’s Cicely! Did you
ever hear of a handsomer name than Cicely? If you
could call this baby Cicely I think it would be perfectly
splendid.”</p>

<p>The little young mother did not answer at once.
She seemed to be considering. But suddenly she
gave a decided nod of her head. “Well then,” she
announced firmly, “I’ll call the baby Cicely. I’m
sure she’d like to be named by so good a little girl as
you are. So Cicely she will be called, Cicely Bell.
They go nicely together, don’t they, without any
middle name to interfere? When she wakes I’ll tell
her her name’s Cicely.”</p>

<p>“Whose name is Cicely?”</p>

<p>The entire tea-party turned around in confusion and
there in the doorway stood Miss Cissy herself and just
behind her a tall and very elegant gentleman.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” laughed she. “I hope we are not intruding.
But please tell me, before we run away and
leave you to yourselves again, whose name is
Cicely?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Polly seemed to be the only one who could find her
tongue. “Why&mdash;why, the baby’s,” she cried eagerly.
“Don’t you see her here in my lap? Mrs. Bell let me
name her. And isn’t she the prettiest, cunningest
baby in the world. See her tiny hands and her darling
ears! And isn’t she good? She let me put her
to sleep. Oh, if she hadn’t been the best baby she
couldn’t have been named Cicely.”</p>

<p>Miss Cissy flushed with pleasure and amusement at
the genuine compliment and coming forward knelt
down before Polly’s knee.</p>

<p>“She is indeed a dear baby,” she said, taking one
of the wee pink fists in hers and kissing it lightly.
“And so you have really called her Cicely?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell nodded and murmured shyly, “Yes’m.
Polly named her.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s my name, you know, and if Polly
gave it to her because it’s mine, of course she is my
namesake, there’s no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Bell flushed and trembled. “Excuse
me, miss,” she stammered faintly. “I didn’t know.
I wouldn’t have made so bold. Indeed I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>But Miss Cissy broke in on her apologies with a
merry laugh. “Oh, pray don’t spoil the compliment,”
she begged. “Why, I am as flattered and pleased as
possible.”</p>

<p>The gentleman who had followed Miss Cissy into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the room seemed almost as flattered and pleased as
she. His face quite glowed with pride and Polly saw
him draw an important looking leathern wallet from
his inner coat pocket and bring out of it a shining
gold piece. “May I shake hands with your young
daughter?” he enquired of Mrs. Bell and when,
almost dumb with astonishment and confusion she
nodded shyly, he bent over the baby as Miss Cissy
had done, took the mite’s hand in his and, uncurling
the tiny fingers tried to close them around the wonderful
coin, saying, as he did so, and too low for any
but Polly to hear; “There! That’s for your name’s
sake, my little woman.”</p>

<p>Polly wanted to jump for joy, but all she could do
was to point silently to the treasure the little Cicely
clutched at tightly with her wee, pink fingers, when
her mother came to bear her away. Mrs. Bell was
quite overcome by the baby’s good fortune and found
it a difficult matter to make her way to the door.
But she managed it somehow and nodded again happily
and gratefully as Miss Cissy called after her:</p>

<p>“I shall not forget my little namesake, Mrs. Bell.
She’ll hear from me every once in a while and I shall
always want to learn how she is getting along. So,
be sure to let me know where she is when you go
away from here.”</p>

<p>The white-capped nurse slipped out with Mrs. Bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and then Hannah, also, made ready to go, but Miss
Cissy detained her.</p>

<p>“I want Mr. Cameron to meet my Polly,” she explained.
“I brought him with me to-day because I
knew our patient was sitting up and I was certain she
would not mind seeing a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no indeed!” murmured sister, flushing however
a little. But her shyness melted away in a
twinkling for if she had been the greatest lady in the
land Mr. Cameron could not have shown her more
deference and respect.</p>

<p>“Ah, he’s a true gentleman,” the little seamstress
thought, and all the while he sat talking to Polly, she
was building beautiful castles in the air in which a
certain lovely young princess named Miss Cicely was
to “live happy ever after” with a certain handsome
young prince, her husband, whose name was&mdash;well,
whatever Mr. Cameron’s happened to be.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts,” announced Miss
Cissy mischievously bending forward and peering up
at sister with eyes full of fun.</p>

<p>Sister’s cheeks flushed guiltily. “Oh, I was just
having a pretty day-dream,” she replied. “I hope it
will come true.”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely’s eyes grew soft and bright. “I think
I know what the dream is,” she said, “and I also hope
it will come true. I think it will come true. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I came here to-day to tell you about it, though it is to
be kept a secret from others for a while. But you are
a privileged person and I thought it would interest
you and I wanted to say that when the dream does
come true you are to have a part in it, my dear.”</p>

<p>This time it was sister’s eyes that grew soft and
bright, seeing which Miss Cissy began to chatter very
fast.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to tell you a story?” she asked.
“Well, I intend to do it anyway. Once upon a time
there was a dear little uncomplaining woman who
was so dutiful and kind that every one loved and respected
her. She kept her wee bit of a home in
apple-pie order and she taught her little sister to be as
dutiful and good and uncomplaining as she was. It
was mighty difficult, I can tell you, to be dutiful and
good and uncomplaining where that little woman
lived, for it was in a great wilderness of a place
where there were wolves that it was almost impossible
to keep from the door. But the little woman, by
working early and late, managed to fight them off
and she never complained. Then one day a great,
cruel tyrant came and said: ‘Hark, little woman!
My name is Pain. I am going to chain you to this
chair. Now will you complain?’</p>

<p>“But the little woman shook her head. Then as the
days grew cold and bleak a great wolf came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
howled hungrily at her door. ‘Let me in! Let me
in!’ And still the little woman shook her head and
did not complain. Then up sprang the small sister
crying: ‘I’m not very big to be sure, but I think I
can help keep that wolf from our door if you will let
me try. He’s a great nuisance and ought to be put
away. I’m sure some one will get hurt if he’s allowed
to stay where he is, even if he doesn’t eat us both up
beforehand.’</p>

<p>“This was so sensible that the little woman consented
to let small sister take a hand in the fight. She gave
her a heart full of courage and many other splendid
weapons for use in such struggles and, do you believe
it? Small sister actually did help to keep that wolf at
a distance. Them one day the story of all this came
to the ears of a person&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, a princess,” corrected sister.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” objected Miss Cicely. “I’m afraid
she was only a person; well, one day the story of all
this came to the ears of a person who said to herself,
‘dear me! these two ladies are just precisely the ones I
have been searching for. They can teach me ever so
many things I don’t know, and if they will only consent
to it, I think I’d like to begin a course of instruction
under them at once.’ So she carried them off
quite out of the wolf’s reach, for she was a very
strong, athletic person, and watched them closely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
little by little she really did begin to learn of them.
Oh, I can’t begin to tell you the number of things
they taught her, but one was to distinguish between
real and make-believe people. Where she lived there
were a great many make-believe people; in fact, she
just escaped being one herself, though please don’t
mention it. But as she grew wiser she learned to tell
the difference between the real thing and the make-believers,
and that changed her whole life, for it
seemed, there were two suitors for her hand and as
both were dressed exactly alike she hadn’t been able
to tell them apart and hadn’t known at all which one
was real and which only make-believe. But after she
had taken several lessons of the little woman and
small sister she searched for the heart of one of them
and, to her horror, found he hadn’t any, that he was
just a poor make-believer dressed up in fine clothes.
And then she searched for the heart of the other and
there it was all safe and sound! the jolliest, biggest,
truest one you ever saw, only his fine clothes hid it
from every one who hadn’t clear enough eyes to
see. Well, of course that settled it. The person said:
‘Yes’ to the real-one-with-the-heart and they are
going to live happy ever after, unless I’m much mistaken.
But you needn’t think the story ends there.
The little woman is going to be rescued from her
awful tyrant and is going to be quite free to come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
go as she chooses. Then the person and the real-one-with-the-heart
are going to take her with them&mdash;over
the hills and far away, and she is to study in books as
she longs to do, and is to hear music and see pictures
and grow, oh! very wise and learned; only, for my
part, I don’t believe she can learn anything better
than what she knows already which is to be dutiful and
kind and uncomplaining and&mdash;well, that’s the beginning
of the end of the story, and I think it’s almost
the best of all.”</p>

<p>By the looks of her, sister did too, for when Mr.
Cameron and Polly managed to glance up from the
mazes of the wonderful cat’s-cradle they were weaving,
they were surprised to see the change that had
come over her face. All the traces of pain and care
were gone and it was as glad and as young as Polly’s
own.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE COUNTRY</span></h2>

<p>Priscilla and Polly proved to be famous travelers,
for everything about the journey interested them.
They thought it great sport to look out of the car-window
and watch the telegraph-poles flash past and
when this grew less amusing they made up words to
the tune the train was grinding out.</p>

<p>“Going to the country! Going to the country!”
chanted Polly, “that is what it says.”</p>

<p>“Priscilla and Polly! Priscilla and Polly!” sang
Priscilla, “don’t you hear it?” And, sure enough,
the tune did actually seem to change as they listened,
and that set them to composing other words for the
wheels to whirl out, and the accommodating train
sang them all.</p>

<p>Then, it was fun to sit opposite each other across
the aisle and count the white cows they saw. First
there seemed to be more on Polly’s side than on
Priscilla’s, but all at once they flashed by a meadow
where quite a drove of cattle was grazing and Priscilla
got all the benefit of the white cows in it.</p>

<p>But when, at last, they arrived at “the country”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
itself, Polly could hardly keep from shouting with delight.
Why, it was just the most beautiful place she
had ever dreamed of, and it was precisely as sister had
said it would be. There were the blossoming flowers
and the singing birds and the green fields all starred
over with dandelions and daisies. The daylight was
fading as they drove through the leafy lanes from the
railroad-station to the house and Priscilla’s tired eyelids
were drooping, but Polly was as wide-awake and
alert as when she started out. She saw a big gate of
“curly” iron set between two huge stone posts, a
cozy little cottage that Hannah said was “the Lodge”
nestling beside it, broad lawns and towering trees
and then, after they had passed all these, a great
house standing high and stately against the glowing
sky. It was beneath the carriage entrance of this
that they stopped and Polly was just beginning to
feel strange and awe-struck when out came James,
with smiling face, to welcome them and she felt at
home at once. In another moment Theresa appeared
and busied herself carrying in the wraps and umbrellas,
while she gave Priscilla a radiant smile and
Polly a not unkindly pat on the shoulder. She even
assisted James to serve them at tea, and was so altogether
amiable and accommodating that Polly concluded
the city air had not agreed with her and that
she felt better in her mind here. But she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
have much opportunity to think about it, for Hannah
whisked her and Priscilla up-stairs and had them
safely tucked into bed in no time and then, somehow,
that was the end of things until the next morning.</p>

<p>It appeared that, in the stable, there was a little
square basket, perched on two wheels, which was to
be drawn by a wee scrap of a shaggy pony not much
bigger than a St. Bernard dog, and this was Priscilla’s
own private and particular turnout. She could not be
trusted alone to manage her fiery steed and therefore
Hannah always went along when she and Polly drove
out, but, dear me! they didn’t mind that! Hannah
was just like another little girl, she was so jolly and
full of fun. What splendid times they had, to be sure,
trundling along the country-roads behind “Oh-my.”</p>

<p>Polly thought Oh-my a very curious name and
Priscilla had to explain that pony received it from
Uncle Arthur who had said “He was little but, Oh
my!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he is little,” asserted Priscilla, “I
love him just the same.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course you do,” responded Polly. “He’s
the best and smartest horse I ever saw. He understands
everything we say and sometimes I think he
likes jokes, ’cause when we make ’em and laugh he
starts up quick as anything, and his sides just shake,
as if he were laughing too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>So Oh-my was made one of them, as it were; was
included in most of their play and had to “make-believe”
he was everything from an elephant in an Indian
jungle to one of the rats that drew Cinderella’s
pumpkin-coach to the ball.</p>

<p>April was gone in a flash and May and June followed
mild and warm. Then, one day in late July
the Sweet P’s had a bright idea. Polly had been telling
Priscilla about when she was “at home, where
the poor people live” and had grown quite excited
over her description of the sickly, poverty-stricken
children that thronged the tenements and swarmed
out into the streets these breathless days, and Priscilla
had sighed and said, “Oh dear! I didn’t know they
were ever like that! I wish I could give them some
money.”</p>

<p>“I earned quite a lot being cash-girl,” ventured
Polly.</p>

<p>“I wish I could be a cash-girl!” murmured Priscilla.</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake!” Hannah exclaimed.</p>

<p>Polly was silent for a moment. Then she jumped
to her feet with a bound. “I tell you what!” she
cried. “Let’s make a fair. We can sew lots of pretty
things and tie ribbons around them and Hannah can
sell them behind a counter and you and I’ll be cash-girls.
Miss Cissy and all the rest will buy from us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and pay real money and we’ll give it to the people
who have the Fresh Air Fun’.”</p>

<p>Hannah turned away her head and coughed violently
into her handkerchief, but Priscilla clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, do! Oh, let’s!” she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sister can make the loveliest lace you ever saw,”
continued Polly, “and she’ll do some for us if we ask
her, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; Oh! I know we could have a
beautiful fair.”</p>

<p>Priscilla was so captivated by the idea that she
could hardly wait for a chance to lay it before her
mother. The dear little girl was timid even with
those she loved best and it required considerable
courage to go and knock upon the great living-room
door and ask if she might, “please come in.”</p>

<p>“Is that my Priscilla?” asked a dear voice in
response.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” replied the younger Sweet P.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer held out her arms and gathered her small
daughter into them with a quick laugh of pleasure.</p>

<p>“Mother is always glad to see her little girl,” she
said.</p>

<p>Priscilla smiled.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing to-day? Having a
nice time?”</p>

<p>Priscilla nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where is Polly?”</p>

<p>“Up-stairs,” whispered Polly’s partner.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” ventured Mrs. Duer, “if there is anything
particular mother can do for her little girl?”</p>

<p>Priscilla ducked her head quickly.</p>

<p>“What is it you want, darling? Tell mother and,
who knows, perhaps she can get it for you.”</p>

<p>Priscilla smiled and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“What is it, sweetheart? Surely you’re not afraid
to speak to mother! What do you want?”</p>

<p>“A fair,” murmured Priscilla with an effort, “We
want to make one, Polly and I do, and tie it with
ribbons and have Hannah sell it behind a counter.
Polly and I will be cash-girls and give the money to
the Fresh Air Fun’.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer hesitated a moment, for Priscilla’s description
of the Sweet P’s plan was not altogether as
clear as it might have been. But the anxious, small
face, flushing and paling with eagerness, hastened her
answer.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, you dear child,” she returned. “If you
and Polly want to have a fair I see no reason why
you should not have one. In fact, I shall be very glad
to help you all I can. You may tell Theresa to give
Hannah my piece-bag and silk-boxes and you can
choose all the fancy bits you like for pin-balls and
needle-cases and book-marks. And when you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
shown what you can do I will fit out a table for you
myself.”</p>

<p>Priscilla did not wait for more. She pressed her
cheek lovingly against her mother’s for an instant
and then hurried away to tell Polly the glorious news.</p>

<p>How they did work after that! They sat under
the trees and stitched away until the robins must
have wondered what manner of nests these large
birds were building that required such an endless
supply of threads and silks and sweet-smelling cotton-wool.
Hannah was kept breathlessly busy, planning
and cutting out and basting, for when fingers are
willing, needles fly.</p>

<p>A little bird (perhaps one of the robins) told Miss
Cissy what was afoot and the first thing the Sweet
P’s knew there she was, declaring she did not intend
to be excluded from all the fun and that if they did
not mind she was going to have a finger in their Fresh
Air pie. In spite of their good-will they had discovered
that a fair meant pretty hard work and, sew as
diligently as they might, they seemed to make very
little progress after the first few days. But when
Miss Cicely arrived everything was changed. She
helped them with such energy that, before they knew
it their stock in trade had outgrown the nursery
limits and had to be shifted to the great picture-gallery.
Then, suddenly, contributions began to pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in from every side. Grandpapa and grandmamma
sent a huge boxful of the most wonderful articles and
all the uncles and aunts followed suit, until it was plain
that the Sweet P’s modest fair was developing into a
very elaborate affair. Miss Cicely had said she would
take charge of one of the booths, but she soon discovered
she could not do it alone, even with the assistance
of two such tireless cash-girls as Priscilla and
Polly, and so she asked their permission to invite some
of the neighborhood ladies to lend a hand. Then
some one suggested that it would sound much grander
if the fair were called a kirmess and, this being agreed
upon, of course all the booths had to be arranged in
the quaint fashion of those at a German village festival
and the attendants dressed in the peasant costume.
The Sweet P’s were to be arrayed in scarlet woolen
petticoats; black-velvet, gold-laced bodices over white
guimpes, with white aprons, black velvet caps, low,
gilt-buckled shoes and dark-blue stockings. Oh-my
heard them talking about it as they sat behind him in
the little basket-cart that he drew so patiently over
hill and dale for their amusement, and Polly was
quite certain his feelings were hurt because he was
not included in the plans for the bazaar.</p>

<p>“The poor, dear thing!” she confided to Priscilla.
“He feels left out in the cold.”</p>

<p>Hannah laughed. “Cold, is it?” she repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fanning herself with her apron and trying to dodge
the hot sun beneath the little canopy-top of the cart.
“Well, he may be glad of it. I wouldn’t mind being
left out in the cold myself for a bit these stifling
days.”</p>

<p>“Well, heat, then,” Polly laughingly corrected herself
but with a pretended pout. “I’m quite certain
he feels left out in the&mdash;heat.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” asked Priscilla. “Oh,
poor pony! We didn’t really mean it! We didn’t
really mean to leave you out.”</p>

<p>“But he mustn’t be left out,” insisted Polly, decidedly.
“He just has got to be part of it, that’s all.
We’ll ask Miss Cissy as soon as we get home what he
can do to help.”</p>

<p>Miss Cicely knew at once. “He can take all the
little boys and girls for a drive; fare, five cents.
We’ll put ribbons and bells on the cart to make it
look festive and we’ll get some nice lad, who is a careful
driver, to dress himself up as a German Hans, and
then you see if Oh-my does not make a nice pocketful
of money for us.”</p>

<p>Polly clapped her hands. She was convinced that
Oh-my understood and would be charmed with the
idea. And certainly this seemed to be the case, for
when the great day of the kirmess arrived he proved
as earnest and excited a worker as any there. Up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
driveway and down he scampered, prancing a bit at
the turning where a low railing protected the road
from the edge of a steep bank of the ravine, and mischievously
making the happy children who crowded
the basket to the brim shriek aloud with excitement
that was half fun, half fear. He was, in fact,
one of the most popular attractions at the festival and
Uncle Arthur, who was in charge of the prize-parcel
booth, threatened to put him off the grounds, he was
so dangerous a rival and monopolized so much of the
custom.</p>

<p>Polly and Priscilla fluttered about like two tireless,
industrious Gretchens, filling orders and carrying
bundles and doing their duty so thoroughly and well
that it was a pleasure to watch them. The grounds
were thronged and it was difficult to get about amid
such a crowd, but their patience never wavered and
the day bade fair to prove a glorious success. Polly
carried a little chamois-skin bag filled with quarters
and dimes and nickels and whenever there was a bill
to change she seemed to be on the spot to assist in
the transaction.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open, Pollykin,” Miss Cicely had
advised. “And don’t let any one escape with the
apology that they have nothing but bills. Make it
easy for them to get change and then they will have
no excuse for not buying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Polly laughed. “I’ll try,” she said, over her shoulder,
as she skipped away, her eyes flashing and her
breath coming fast.</p>

<p>But if the gaily decked booths, the pretty nurses
and children and the gold-laced uniforms of the orchestra-men
gave a festive look to the place in the
daytime, the numberless chains of dainty Chinese
lanterns and sparkling electric lights glowing among
the trees made it appear like fairy-land at night.</p>

<p>Priscilla and Polly were in an ecstasy, for they
were to stay up as long as the kirmess lasted and do
their part to the very end. It was the proudest day
in their lives, for even Oh-my had been led off to his
stable at sunset, and it seemed very grown-up and important
to be tripping about when all the other
children were safely in bed and asleep. But Polly
found her responsibilities heavier than ever, for
whereas the place had been crowded with nurses and
children during the daytime, it was thronged with
gentlemen and ladies now; and gentlemen and ladies
who seemed to carry nothing but big bills in
their pockets, which frequently the saleswomen in
the booths were unable to change. She was here,
there and everywhere at once and as fast as her coins
disappeared she went to Miss Cicely for more.</p>

<p>“Now, here’s another bagful of silver,” explained
Miss Cissy. “Five dollars’ worth, in halves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
quarters and dimes. Take good care of it, dear, and
see that you don’t stumble in the shadows; these
electric lights are shifty and it is easy to trip.”</p>

<p>Polly picked her way carefully over the patches of
light and shadow in the grass and fastened her fingers
more securely about the money-bag she carried. She
was congratulating herself that she had not had one
mishap all day and she was determined it should not
be her fault if everything did not end as well as it
had begun. She was proud of Miss Cissy’s confidence
in her and anxious to prove she deserved it. These
thoughts and a crowd of others were flashing through
her mind when&mdash;alas for Polly! she never knew how
it happened, but before she had time to prevent it,
she had missed her footing, had fallen, struck her
head sharply against the iron railing that guarded the
driveway from the steep bank of the ravine and was
only saved from pitching headlong down into the
gorge by the slender bar itself. For one instant she
lay quite still, then she struggled to her feet in terror,
for in the midst of her pain and shock she realized
that her precious bag was gone. The jolt of her fall
had wrenched it from her grasp. Her hands were
bruised and scratched by the sharp gravel-stones, a
rapidly-rising lump upon her head throbbed heavily,
but she lost no time in considering these. Her one
thought was for the money-bag. On hands and knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
she crept up and down and across the spot where
she had fallen, groping for her treasure, but all
to no purpose; the bag was nowhere to be found.
Big tears of dismay welled up into her eyes, as second
after second passed and still she had not recovered it.
Suddenly she saw a figure coming toward her that
proved to be Theresa hurrying to the house on some
errand or other.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the maid pausing in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Polly almost sobbed, “I fell&mdash;&mdash; I
tripped and fell, and my money-bag is gone&mdash;with
five dollars in it.”</p>

<p>Theresa gave a pretended gasp of horror. “Gracious
me!” she exclaimed. “You are in trouble, for sure,
aren’t you? I don’t wonder you feel bad. Five dollars!
That’s a big pile of money, when you haven’t
got it! Like’s not your bag is at the bottom of the
ravine this minute, floating down the brook. I
declare I’m sorry for you, for of course if you don’t
hand it over prompt and quick to Miss Cicely, she’ll
think hard things of you, and maybe turn you out
besides. Goodness! if it was me, I’d run away this
minute and never come back here again. I’d be that
frightened and ashamed!”</p>

<p>Polly stopped short in her search and looked up at
Theresa with a new terror in her eyes. “What&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
do you mean?” she stammered. “Why should
I be frightened&mdash;and ashamed? It wasn’t my fault!
I tried to be careful. Why should they turn me
out?”</p>

<p>“Because, silly! That’s why,” replied the maid
sourly. “If you don’t hand that bag over to Miss
Cicely right away she’ll think hard things of you.
She’ll say you’re careless and not to be trusted. Oh,
dear, there is no knowing what she will say and do,
she’ll be so angry at the loss of that much money. I
wouldn’t risk it, if I were you. I’d run away before
they found out.”</p>

<p>Polly gasped painfully. “It isn’t my fault,” she
repeated, sobbing. “I have tried to be careful, I have,
really and truly. I don’t think Miss Cissy will think
those things of me you say she will, but&mdash;but&mdash;even
if she does, I can’t run away. It wouldn’t be right to
run away. If I can’t find the bag and she blames me,
I’ll have to&mdash;to tell her all about it and stand it,
somehow.”</p>

<p>Theresa gave a sharp laugh. “Well, do as you
please,” she cried harshly. “It’s none of my business,
I’m sure. But I can tell you this much, you won’t
find your bag, and you will be blamed, so there!
You’re mighty brave and courageous now, but wait
till you’re turned out in disgrace, and then see how
you’ll feel. I guess you’ll wish you had taken my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
advice then. Listen to me! if you want, I’ll hide you
in my room to-night, and to-morrow morning I’ll
smuggle you out of the house as quiet as a mouse,
and no one will ever be the wiser. I’ll slip you down
to the station, and you can go to your sister in the
cars, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>For a moment Polly saw herself as Theresa pictured
her: blamed, disgraced, turned out of this home
maybe, where every one had been so kind to her, and
it seemed as if she could not face it.</p>

<p>“Will you do as I say?” demanded Theresa eagerly,
catching her by the arm.</p>

<p>Polly gave a quick, low sob and shook her head.</p>

<p>Theresa released her hold with sudden violence,
turned short round upon her heel and, without another
word, strode toward the house. Polly looked after
her with misery and despair in every line of her pale
little face. Then she fell to searching again, feeling
about blindly along every inch of the spot where she
had fallen. But still the bag could not be found.
Time was flying, and Theresa had said if she did not
return the money at once they would think hard
things of her. She could not believe it! She could
not bear it! She struggled to her feet and tried to
gather her wits together. What should she do?
What would sister tell her to do if she were here and
knew the truth. Suddenly Polly gave a little gasp of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
joy and flew toward the house as fast as her feet
would carry her. She had found a way out of her
trouble, and her heart beat so quick with the relief of
it, that it almost took her breath away. Up into the
nursery she ran, and to her own particular little table
upon which her bank stood. It was so heavy with
money it would hardly rattle, and every cent of it was
her very own by right, to do with as she chose. But
how was she to get at the money? The bank was
locked and she had given sister the key. She twisted
and tugged at it fiercely, but only a stray copper or
nickle slipped through the opening in the top, and at
this rate it would take her all night to shake out the
rest. She thought of James. James would help her!
James was a good friend of hers. She flew down-stairs
like a small whirlwind, and surprised the butler
as he stood in the front doorway, watching the gaieties
outside and resting for a moment from his labors. He
heard her out patiently, though she was so excited her
words came in gasps, and she made confusing work of
her story.</p>

<p>“So you fell and hurt yourself, and lost your bag
of change, eh?” he commented. “Well, I declare,
that’s rare hard luck, it is! No mistake! And you
want me to open this affair and get the money out of
it to make up for what you lost? Well, you’re a real
up-and-down square one, you are. Now just you wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I’ve a big ring of keys down-stairs, and I’ll bring it
up and see if we can’t fit one into this lock, and if we
can’t&mdash;why!&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not wait to explain what would happen
then but ran quickly below and before many minutes
was back again and trying one key after another into
the obstinate lock that absolutely refused to be fitted.
Polly, at his side, twisted and jerked with impatience
and excitement, and when at last James shook his
head and said with a sigh: “It’s no use! there ain’t
one in the whole lot that’ll do,” she almost broke into
crying again.</p>

<p>The kind fellow gave her an encouraging glance.
“Don’t you worry,” he said. “If we can’t do one
way we’ll do another. If we can’t unlock the door
we’ll have to break open the bank. Are you
willing?”</p>

<p>Polly nodded eagerly. “Yes, oh yes!” she
quivered.</p>

<p>“Well, come along then,” returned James and led
the way down-stairs. Polly following dumbly. She
could hardly wait while he got from his tool-chest the
things he needed and set to work. Once, twice, three
times the heavy hammer fell, and then, with a cry of
joy, Polly made a dash toward the shattered bank
and gathered up the stream of coins that poured out
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, James, I thank you ever so much,” she cried
gratefully.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better count your money,” suggested
the butler sensibly. “Are you sure there’s enough
here? It takes a good many pennies and nickles to
make five dollars, you know.”</p>

<p>The next moment he was almost sorry he had
spoken when he saw all the brightness vanish from
her face as quickly as it had come there. But she did
not stop to lament.</p>

<p>“Take half, please,” she said, “and count it and I’ll
count the other part and then we’ll add what we’ve
both got.”</p>

<p>Poor James! He was not, as he himself admitted,
“a lightening calculator,” and his progress was very
slow, so that Polly had announced: “One dollar and
sixteen cents,” while he was still stumbling over, “A
quarter&mdash;and ten cents: that makes thirty-five! And
five more: that makes forty,” and so on. Would he
never get done? Would he never say, “One dollar!”
Suppose there were not enough!</p>

<p>“One dollar!” announced James triumphantly, and
Polly’s heart beat fast for he still held quite a little
heap of coins that were uncounted. It was a
great trial of patience to stand there and wait and
wait, when so much was at stake. Polly wanted to
jump up and down and cry: “Hurry! Hurry!” to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
urge him on, but she shut her teeth hard and kept the
words back.</p>

<p>“One dollar and fifty!” droned James. “And a
dime: that makes sixty: and five pennies: that
makes sixty-five. And a quarter: that makes ninety:
a dollar and ninety! I guess I’ve got most of the big
pieces! And a dime: two dollars! Two dollars and
ten cents! fifteen! eighteen! and another dime:
that’s twenty-eight! And, hey there! If here ain’t
a fifty-cent piece! That makes two dollars and
seventy-eight. I say, two dollars and seventy-eight is
better than nothing! And your one dollar and sixteen
added to that! why that makes&mdash;that makes&mdash;three
dollars and ninety-four. Now ten cents makes
four dollars and four cents and six more is ten and&mdash;and&mdash;four
dollars and ten cents and&mdash;and&mdash;that’s
all!”</p>

<p>Yes, Polly had seen it was all. A couple of great
tears crowded out the sight of James and the cruelly
disappointing pile of money he held, and then rolled
down her burning cheeks in two hot streams. But
the next moment she had brushed them hastily aside,
for the butler had grasped her arm with a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” he shouted. “See here! What’s the
matter with counting in this nice one-dollar bill lying
there all hid away where we didn’t see it! I ain’t
a lightening calculator, and I ain’t proud if I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
handsome, but the way I add up four dollars and ten
cents and a one dollar bill, brings it up to five dollars,
with a silver dime over. Now, young lady, just you
take this money and skip as fast as ever you can.”</p>

<p>Skip! Why Polly fairly flew and James, looking
after her with a smile, patted his vest-pocket approvingly,
muttering to himself: “I got a dollar’s worth
of fun just seeing the worry go out of her eyes and
the glad look come back again. I ain’t rich, but I’m
satisfied I spent that money right!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">PRISCILLA’S VICTORY</span></h2>

<p>So, after all, the kirmess ended in a blaze of glory
for Polly as well as for every one else and she would
have thought herself the happiest girl in the world
even if, at the close of the evening, when they were
sitting under the trees, eating ice cream and cake
and resting after the fatigue of the day, Miss Cicely
had not risen and said:</p>

<p>“Now I hope all present who vote our kirmess a
success will give a cheer for the two ladies who, from
the first, have been the means of making it so. I propose
a cheer for our two Sweet P’s.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers and an extra one for good measure!”
cried Uncle Arthur jumping to his feet, and
although Aunt Laura murmured, “Don’t be absurd,
Arthur!” they were given with a will.</p>

<p>But the next day! Oh dear, how different everything
seemed then! The grounds were littered with
torn paper and scorched lanterns and scraps of twine
and tattered shreds of muslin and bunting. The
grass of the lawns was cruelly trodden down and, in
some places, fairly torn up by the roots. Indoors it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was no better. The articles that had been left over
from the fair were scattered here, there, and everywhere
in everybody’s way.</p>

<p>Priscilla looked pale and worn out and, for the first
time since Polly had known her, was, as Hannah expressed
it, “cross as two sticks.” Polly herself was
far from well. There was a big aching bump upon
her head and her body felt stiff and sore all over.
Her cheeks were flushed and feverish and she, as well
as Priscilla, felt so tired and forlorn that they could
hardly drag themselves to the stable on a visit of condolence
to Oh-my, when it was discovered that the
poor little pony had been overdriven the day before,
had caught cold and would have to be very carefully
tended before he could recover. Even Hannah was
inclined to be irritable, and there was no doubt at all
about Theresa’s and the other servants’ ill-temper.</p>

<p>The sight of the empty place upon her table where
her precious bank had stood made Polly so melancholy
that she felt like sitting down and having a “good cry”
over it, but she remembered sister’s advice to “hold her
little head up no matter how she felt” and decided that
she would follow it at once. But the sacrifice of her
savings meant a real struggle, for Polly had had great
plans as to what she meant to do with her money and
now it looked as if all those lovely dreams could never
be realized. As soon as her breakfast was eaten she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
left the nursery, inclining to confess to Miss Cissy
about the little chamois-skin bag, but everything was
in confusion down-stairs for, it appeared, Miss Cicely
had to hurry off at once to join a party of friends at
the seaside, the rest of the relations were going their
own ways and, in a very little while, the house would
be left deserted and dull to struggle with the sultry,
trying weather alone.</p>

<p>“Let’s come out under the trees and play house,”
suggested Polly to Priscilla.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” Priscilla murmured, a little fretfully,
letting herself drop limply upon the veranda
cushions with a whimper.</p>

<p>“My child, Ruthie Carter, has got the mumps and
the doctor said I must take her to the seashore right
away,” explained Polly, clasping the invalid-doll in
her arms and trying to make herself believe she cared
whether Ruthie Carter recovered from her attack or
not.</p>

<p>Priscilla did not answer.</p>

<p>“Is your baby quite well, Mrs. Priscilla?” inquired
Mrs. Polly politely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Priscilla shook her head silently, and after a
few more unsuccessful attempts to engage her in conversation,
Mrs. Polly gave it up and sauntered slowly
across the lawn, bound for the seashore to which the
imaginary doctor had advised her to take her ailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
child. She chose the pretty, rustic summer-house
called Pine Lodge, for her play to-day, because it was
shady and quiet there, and its sides, which were open
half-way down from the roof, let the breeze in
unhindered. A bench ran round the walls of the
place, and was very useful and convenient for housekeeping;
purposes, for, with a little arrangement and
imagination, it could be made to serve as table, cupboard,
bed, piano, and a host of other things, just as
one chose. One section of it only was forbidden
ground: that running along the side of the summer-house
that overhung the ravine. It was a rule remaining
over from Priscilla’s baby-days that she was
never to be left alone in Pine Lodge, and that she was
never, never, never to mount upon that particular
portion of the bench, for though now she was
old enough to realize the danger of leaning over
the wall’s edge, an accident might occur, and the
ravine was deep and its steep walls rocky and sheer,
while the tall trees that clung to them showed many a
bare and unsupported root. When Polly had passed
quite out of sight Priscilla began to cry. She had not
wanted to play with her, but neither had she wanted
Polly to go off and play by herself.</p>

<p>“She’s real mean to leave me all alone,” she sobbed
irritably. “I don’t think she’s very polite.”</p>

<p>But only a robin, hopping nimbly across the driveway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
heard her complaint, and as he did not seem to
sympathize with her, she felt it was of no use to say
any more. She gathered herself up with a pettish
sigh and set out to follow Polly across the lawn.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Polly as she came in sight.</p>

<p>“Hello,” returned Priscilla.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you bring your child with you? The seashore
will do her a lot of good. My Ruthie Carter’s
almost well already.”</p>

<p>Priscilla shook her head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go and fetch your baby?” inquired
Polly. “Let’s play you came to visit me and
didn’t bring her along, ’cause you were afraid she’d
be a bother, and I said: ‘No, indeed, I’d be pleased
to have her!’”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” returned Priscilla. “My feet
hurt. You go.”</p>

<p>“My feet hurt, too, and so do my arms and all the
rest of me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’re very polite, Polly Carter,
so there! Your head doesn’t feel half as bad as mine
does.”</p>

<p>Polly jumped up and laid Priscilla’s hand on the
big bump that was throbbing beneath her hair.
“There!” she said, triumphantly, “what do you think
of that? Doesn’t that thump? And it aches like
anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I tripped last night in the dark and knocked it
against that iron fence by the driveway. I was running
as quick as I could to make change and all of a
sudden I fell down and my money-bag&mdash;the one Miss
Cissy gave me with five dollars in it&mdash;jogged out of
my hand and I hit my head and&mdash;I guess you’ll believe
I don’t feel very well now!”</p>

<p>Under all Priscilla’s real sweetness of nature there
lay a hidden rock of obstinacy that made her, at
times, a very difficult little personage to deal with.
Hannah had encountered it often and often, but
Hannah was indulgent and excused her pet to herself
by saying: “She’s so young; she’ll outgrow it by
and by.”</p>

<p>Polly had, up to this, given in almost entirely to
Priscilla, no matter what her whims might be, and so
had not really had any conflict with the quiet persistence
and iron will that underlay the little girl’s
other really lovable traits. But she was to have one
now.</p>

<p>Priscilla listened attentively to the story of the bag
and the bruise and then repeated slowly: “I don’t
think you’re very polite. I think you might get my
doll.”</p>

<p>“Hannah told me not to wait on you so much. She
says it spoils you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Priscilla silently regarded the toes of her shoes and
seemed to be considering. Her lips were pressed
tightly together, and she did not reply for a minute.
Then she said gently: “I think you might get my
doll.”</p>

<p>Polly pretended not to hear. She bent over the
mumpy Ruth and drew her handkerchief across the
sick infant’s chest to shield her from the supposed
fresh sea-breeze that was blowing inshore smartly
from the great stretch of imaginary ocean beyond.</p>

<p>“I think you might get my doll,” droned Priscilla
again.</p>

<p>“I’ve been hunting for that bag so long this morning
I’m tired clear through to my bones,” explained
Polly at length, with a touch of reproach in her voice.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose it is?” asked Priscilla.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Down the bank, maybe, and in the
water. Theresa said it was. I went back to the
place before breakfast and searched and searched.”</p>

<p>“Let’s lean over the edge of this and p’raps we can
see it.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested Polly, quickly. “Don’t you!
don’t you! Your mother ’spressly told us never to
do that. She said you might fall over. She said I
was never to leave you here alone&mdash;and that’s another
reason why I can’t go get your doll.”</p>

<p>For answer Priscilla rose slowly and crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
summer-house to the side that overhung the ravine.
Very slowly and deliberately she mounted the bench,
knelt up upon it and, leaning far over the ledge,
peered into the dark depths of the ravine
below.</p>

<p>Polly held her breath for a moment, too horrified
to speak. Then she gasped out imploringly: “Don’t,
don’t! Oh, Priscilla, don’t do so! Your mother told
you not to. She said it was dangerous!”</p>

<p>For response Priscilla leaned out a little further.</p>

<p>Polly was speechless. She grasped the little girl’s
dress and clutched it fiercely; it was all she could do.</p>

<p>“I think you might get my doll,” repeated Priscilla.</p>

<p>“Oh, Priscilla, how can I? I couldn’t leave you
here alone like this for anything. They’d think I was
awful; they’d scold.”</p>

<p>“You might get my doll.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll lean out further.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you! Don’t you!”</p>

<p>“I will, ’less you get my doll!”</p>

<p>Priscilla was beginning quite to enjoy herself. Her
usually gentle heart was hardened now with the determination
to have her own way at any cost. There
was a fearful excitement in leaning over that forbidden
ledge, and it was “fun” of a sort to know
that Polly stood in fear of what she would do. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
did not draw back an inch, and the hand on her skirt
tightened fiercely.</p>

<p>“Let go my dress!”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t: you’ll fall!”</p>

<p>“I won’t fall if you’ll get my doll!”</p>

<p>“Will you get down if I do? Really and truly?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you’ll get my doll, I’ll get down.”</p>

<p>Polly struggled with herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t,” she panted. “They told me not to
let you be here alone. I can’t! Honest, I can’t.”</p>

<p>“I think I see your bag. It’s over there! ’Way
over there down behind the roots of that tree,” declared
Priscilla, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“Never mind! Don’t lean over so! Don’t look!
You’ll get dizzy! Come away! Let’s play&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If you’ll get my doll.”</p>

<p>Polly gasped helplessly. “Well&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;” she
stammered, “I&mdash;I will&mdash;if you’ll solemnly promise to
come down, I will.”</p>

<p>Priscilla had won the battle.</p>

<p>“I’ll promise,” she said gently and slid back upon
the bench and then down to the safety of the floor, as
quietly and obediently as if she had never been defiant
in all her life.</p>

<p>But the scare and the struggle had been too much
for Polly. At sight of Priscilla’s innocent air, her
eyes blazed resentfully. She felt, somehow, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was being terribly wronged and imposed upon, and
for the first time since she had known Priscilla she
was thoroughly indignant at her.</p>

<p>The sound of the sweet little voice repeating softly:
“Aren’t you going to get my doll?” roused her to a
sudden quick and uncontrollable anger. She grasped
Priscilla by the arm and shook her fiercely; shook
her till her bright, flossy hair danced up and down
upon her shoulders in a golden cloud and all the color
was gone from her lips and cheeks. Polly’s own face
was scarlet and her eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>“You are a naughty girl!” she cried, vehemently.
“As naughty as you can be. You ought to be
punished!”</p>

<p>Priscilla simply gazed at her and made no answer.
She was so pale, Polly’s heart misgave her.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m sorry I shook you,” she burst out remorsefully.
“I didn’t mean to, Priscilla. I don’t know
what made me do it! I’m awfully sorry.”</p>

<p>Still Priscilla was silent.</p>

<p>“You’re not angry at me, are you, Priscilla?”</p>

<p>Priscilla’s white lips opened just far enough to let
out the words: “I think you might get my doll.”</p>

<p>Polly started to run, but on the threshold she
stopped and turned back. “Remember what you’ve
promised,” she said, with trembling lips.</p>

<p>Priscilla nodded; the next minute she was alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
She watched Polly scudding across the lawn, her soft
blue eyes grown hard and gray as flint. The thoughts
in her busy brain swarmed as stinging midges. She
was very, very angry. Never before in all her young
life had rough hands been laid upon her. Polly had
shaken her! Her face was white as snow, but her
heart was hot with fury. She was shocked, frightened
and terribly resentful. Polly had said she was
naughty and ought to be punished! No one had ever
before spoken so harshly to her. It was Polly who
was naughty and ought to be punished. Polly had
said she was sorry, but there was time enough to
think of that. The thing to do now was to pay Polly
back for what she had done. The stinging thought-midges
in the back of her brain buzzed so loud they
made her dizzy. In a minute Polly would come back
with her doll and then she would want to make up
and be friends again. Priscilla’s lips pressed tight,
one upon the other. She did not want to be friends
with any one just yet. All she wanted was to pay
Polly back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polly was making what haste she could
in search of the miserable doll that, as she said to herself,
had been the beginning of all the trouble, but it
was not in its accustomed place in the nursery, nor yet
in the little girls’ bedroom. Hannah was busy helping
settle the place down-stairs and could not stop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
tell her where it was likely to be found. Up-stairs
and down she hurried, but to no purpose; here, there
and everywhere she hunted, but all in vain. She
dared not go back to Priscilla without the doll and
still, she had been told over and over again never to
leave her alone in that dangerous Lodge. What
should she do? As a last resort she burrowed among
the cushions upon the veranda where Priscilla had
lain a little while before and there, sure enough, lay
the wretched rag-baby, peacefully and uncomplainingly
buried beneath a mountain of down. Polly
snatched her up fiercely and started across the
lawn.</p>

<p>“Helloa there, Polly!”</p>

<p>It was James who called.</p>

<p>Polly paused and turned. “Oh, James, I’m in an
awful hurry,” she gasped anxiously.</p>

<p>The butler smiled. “Another of your busy days,
I s’pose,” he remarked teasingly. “You seem to have
a good many of ’em, first and last. Take my advice,
go slower and you’ll go surer. It pays in the long run&mdash;and
the short one too, for that matter. The more
haste the worse speed, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, James,” protested Polly again.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re catching a train I guess I’d better
not detain you. I just had something to say, I
thought you’d like to know, that’s all. About the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
little chamois-bag you dropped last night. I’m going
down the ravine to hunt for it.”</p>

<p>But Polly had sped out of hearing before he had
finished his sentence and he strolled slowly after her
saying to himself: “She must want something to do,
sprinting around like that, this hot day! But children
don’t seem to mind the heat. My! But her face is
red! All the blood’s in her head! Hannah ought to
tell her she hadn’t ought to exert herself like that
when it’s ninety-four in the shade.”</p>

<p>It seemed no time at all to Priscilla before Polly
reappeared across the lawn. She was holding the doll
and running as fast as her feet would carry her.</p>

<p>The biggest and fiercest thought-midge of all stung
Priscilla with so sharp a point that she started as if
she had been pricked with a needle. In a flash she
saw how she could revenge herself on Polly, could
punish her so that her face would look as queer and
terrified as it had done a little while ago when she had
been afraid Priscilla would fall over the ledge of Pine
Lodge and had implored her to come away from it;
in fact had made her getting down from the bench the
condition on which the doll was to be brought. Priscilla
had gotten down, as she had promised to do.
But she had not promised not to get up again. Her
teeth set hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="500" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHE WAS LEANING FAR, FAR OUT</p>
</div>

<p>As she drew near the entrance of the summer-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Polly heaved a long sigh of relief. There was Priscilla
safe and sound, standing in the doorway just as
she had left her. She had disobeyed orders, of course,
when she left Priscilla alone in Pine Lodge, but she
felt sure that would be forgiven her when she explained
how it was she had come to go and that, notwithstanding,
Priscilla was unharmed.</p>

<p>“See, Priscilla,” she cried, eagerly as soon as she
was within earshot, “I’ve got her. I would have
come quicker, only I couldn’t find her anywhere. I
hunted every place I could think of and where d’you
s’pose she was? Under the cushions on the veranda.
Now we can play and it’ll be ever so nice.”</p>

<p>Priscilla made no response. She did not even hold
out her arms for the doll. She waited until Polly
reached the threshold and then she turned on her heel
and very slowly and deliberately walked away from
her and toward the forbidden side of the Lodge.
Polly halted a moment in bewilderment and the skin
all over her body seemed to grow cold and to be
shriveling together, while her eyes turned into two
burning balls that smarted and stung, for Priscilla
was climbing up upon the bench and leaning far, far
over.</p>

<p>Polly tried to call out but no sound would come.
After a second Priscilla turned her head and glanced
around with a look in her eyes that no one had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
seen there before. She had determined to punish
Polly and she meant to do it thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Priscilla,” gasped Polly. “Please, please&mdash;get
down! Remember, you promised.”</p>

<p>For answer, Priscilla stared at her coldly with those
strange gray, steely eyes of hers and then bent her
body far over the dangerous ledge again.</p>

<p>Polly’s breath caught in a tight, choking knot in
her throat and she turned sick all over, and faint and
weak. There was one second in which she was quite
blind and then another in which everything before her
appeared to burn right through her eyes and back into
her brain. The motionless leaves on the trees; the
patches of blue sky through the green boughs: the
soft, gray slab-side walls of Pine Lodge: the low
bench running round them; Priscilla standing upon
the bench and leaning far, far out, and then&mdash;and
then&mdash;no Priscilla at all. Without a cry, without a
sound she had vanished over the edge,&mdash;she had lost
her balance and had fallen into the ravine!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT HAPPENED TO PRISCILLA</span></h2>

<p>James followed leisurely after in the path Polly
had taken, mopping his perspiring forehead and thinking
uncomplimentary things about the weather.</p>

<p>“Yes, children don’t mind runnin’ when it’s ninety-four
in the shade,” he observed, “but as for me, you
don’t catch me hurryin’ myself to-day, not for nothin’
nor nobody. Hark! What’s that?”</p>

<p>A sharp, piercing, frantic cry tore the stillness into
echoes and went resounding down the length of the
gorge. The butler paused an instant; the cry was
repeated again and again. Without more ado he
started into a fierce run that brought him, in no time
at all, to the threshold of Pine Lodge where, peering
in, he saw Polly crouching on the further bench, leaning
over the ledge and uttering shriek after shriek for
help. He sprang to her side with a bound, gave one
quick glance into the gloom of the ravine below and
then, with a warning “Hush!” to her and an encouraging
nod and smile to the white face turned
toward him from a tangle of brush and gnarled roots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
upon the bank beneath, wheeled about and, like a
flash, disappeared around the side of the summer-house.</p>

<p>Polly caught her breath in a queer, gulping sob.
After what seemed to her like ages of time help had
come! Now if Priscilla could but keep her hold upon
that bare pine-tree root to which she was clinging!
If the bare pine-tree root would not give way beneath
her grasp! In some miraculous way she had escaped
plunging headlong to the bottom of the gorge. Her
fall had been broken by the tangle of wild bushes and
the undergrowth of strong young saplings lining the
bank, and in the quick second in which she felt the
earth beneath her again she had managed to brace
herself and cling to a supporting root. But her
strength was almost gone and Polly could see that in
a moment more her slender courage must give way.
Would James never come? Why had he not leaped
right over the side of the Lodge and reached Priscilla
that way? It would have been quicker. Surely it
would have been quicker! But James knew what he
was about, if Polly did not. He had seen at a glance
that the weight of a heavier body might readily dislodge
the insecure rocks and earth that were serving
to support the little girl and that his only safe course
was to skirt the Lodge, go to a farther point of the
bank and, by slipping and sliding down, as best he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
might, reach the bottom of the ravine and rescue
Priscilla from below. It was, in reality, but a few
seconds before Polly saw him again, swinging himself
over the little rail that fenced in the bank, and
dropping carefully down, down from rock to rock to
the bed of the shallow stream that flowed at the base
of the gorge. Once at the bottom he was less impeded.
In a twinkling he had reached the point
where Priscilla hung, had found a firm foothold, and
was urging her to drop into one of his strong arms
while he clung to the supporting roots of a towering
pine with the other. Polly watched him with straining
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid! Drop!” commanded James
encouragingly.</p>

<p>Whether Priscilla heard him or not Polly could not
tell, but the frantic grasp of her little fingers around
the root did not relax and her white face and wide-open
eyes stared up blindly from out of the soft
gloom below without a trace of life in them. “Don’t
be afraid! Drop!” repeated James.</p>

<p>He drew himself up an inch or two higher and
flung his strong arm tight about her. It was not an
instant too soon for, with a sudden, sharp snap and
crack of sundering wood the half-rotten root she
clung to gave way beneath her gripping fingers. The
sound of it and the feeling that she had lost her support,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
seemed the only things she had reason enough
left to realize. With a long, low cry of despair her
arms dropped to her sides and her eyelids closed upon
her staring eyes.</p>

<p>James’ strong arm was firm and steady; he held
her close. Polly breathlessly watched him as, inch
by inch, he descended the bank to the bottom of the
gorge and then carefully picked his way along to the
far point where a flight of wooden steps, securely
fastened to the rock, led up the terrace beyond.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time the thought flashed into
Polly’s mind, “What would Priscilla’s mother say?”</p>

<p>She slid down to the floor, forgetful of dolls, play-toys
and everything else, and ran blindly back to the
house. Her flying feet brought her to the entrance
before James, with his little burden, had fairly
reached the terrace.</p>

<p>“Hannah! Oh, Hannah!” she called out, as soon
as she had crossed the door-sill and was actually
within the hall.</p>

<p>Hannah hurried to her from the living-room,
alarmed by her terror-stricken voice.</p>

<p>“What on earth is it, child? For pity’s sake what’s
happened now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hannah!” Polly panted, “Priscilla! It’s
Priscilla! She&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash; We were in Pine Lodge
and she fell over into the ravine and James has got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
her&mdash;he’s bringing her in now, I guess. Oh, Hannah!
Hannah&mdash;&mdash; She was alive! But her eyes shut when
the root broke and now I’m afraid she’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Polly!” commanded Hannah sternly.
“Stop your crying. Mrs. Duer mustn’t hear you.
She mustn’t know&mdash;yet. You say James has got
her? Oh, here he is! Give her to me, James!
Quick, quick, man! How slow you are!”</p>

<p>“Go easy, Hannah!” the young man said. “She’s
all right. Don’t get upset! She’s got a few bruises,
no doubt, and her hands are torn a bit, but she’ll pull
through all right when she comes out of this faint
and has time to get over the shock and the fright
of it.”</p>

<p>But Hannah hardly heard him. She gathered her
darling into her arms with a sort of savage eagerness,
and, puffing and panting with the exertion and the
heat, carried her up-stairs into her mother’s room and
closed the door. Polly dared not follow.</p>

<p>Oh, the wretched hours that passed before the
doctor came! And the miserable hours that passed
while he was there! That closed door seemed to shut
Polly out from all the brightness and joy of the world
and she felt she would never, never, never be happy
again. Midday came, but no one wanted to eat. The
dreary afternoon crawled slowly past and the great
red sun began to sink. Polly could not swallow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
supper; James had to carry it away again almost
untasted.</p>

<p>“Don’t you go to being so down-hearted,” he said,
kindly. “Little Miss Priscilla is coming out all right,
never you fear. She’s had an ugly shock, but she’ll
get over it by and by and be as right as a trivet
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, James, do you really think so?” Polly cried,
longing to be comforted.</p>

<p>“Sure!” responded the butler cheerfully.</p>

<p>Late that night Hannah, stealing noiselessly up-stairs
was surprised to hear Polly’s voice softly calling
to her through the dark.</p>

<p>“Hannah! is that you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Polly. Why aren’t you asleep, child?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. How’s Priscilla?”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, the doctor isn’t ready to
say. He isn’t worryin’ much about her bruises, but&mdash;but&mdash;well,
we’ll have to wait, that’s all. She’s got
considerable fever and the fright won’t leave her.
She drops asleep for a minute or two and then starts
up wide awake and shrieking with terror. She can’t
get any rest, poor lamb. It’s that that makes us most
anxious. Of course we don’t take for truth anything
she says in this state, but it’s curious how contrary-minded
people get when they’re not quite themselves.
She has an idea you’re trying to hurt her and she cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
out to us not to let you come into the room. I’ve
told her mother over and over again you wouldn’t see
a hair of Priscilla’s head harmed and you wouldn’t,
now would you, Polly?”</p>

<p>Hannah paused a moment for Polly’s answer, but
when none came she went on consolingly, “I’ve told
Mrs. Duer not to mind the foolish things Priscilla
says, for it isn’t believable that you would lay hands
on her to shake her or that it was because of a falling-out
you had that she fell over the side of the lodge.
Only, you see, Polly, while Priscilla’s head is like this
and she has such foolish sick fancies it wouldn’t do to
excite her and so you’ll just have to keep out of the
way for a while, and not fret to go to her. When
she’s up and about again it’ll be all right, but for the
present it’s pretty hard on us all&mdash;the waiting. Now,
go to sleep, like a good girl and to-morrow you shall
tell just how it all happened. You’re not to blame,
I’m sure, Polly, but it will be better all round for you
to let Mrs. Duer know the right of the case and that
Priscilla’s saying you shook her and was the cause of
her fall, is just something she’s dreaming and that it
isn’t really true at all.”</p>

<p>Then, with a tired “Good-night! Now go to sleep
like a good girl,” and without waiting for more,
Hannah left the room to return to Priscilla, and Polly
was left in the darkness and the silence again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The big clock in the corner ticked out the seconds
with slow distinctness; a little screech-owl in the
branches of the big oak-tree just beyond the window
repeated its dismal, quivering call. Polly buried her
face in the pillows and trembled. She had thought
she was unhappy before, when Priscilla’s sickness was
the only weight upon her heart. But now there was
a worse one added to that. The knowledge that she
would be held responsible for the accident and whatever
resulted from it.</p>

<p>Poor Polly! She had quite forgotten the little tiff
of the morning but now it came back to her with
cruel clearness for Hannah’s words showed plainly
enough that Priscilla had not forgotten. What could
she say the next morning when Mrs. Duer should ask
her if what Priscilla said was true? For what Priscilla
said was true: Polly could not deny it. It was
true Polly had shaken Priscilla and Priscilla “to pay
her back” it appeared, had leaned over the ledge of
the Lodge. She saw it all now. So it was true also
that Priscilla’s fall was somehow due to Polly’s
temper. It all seemed very terrible and confusing
and hopeless. She knew in her heart that she was
not utterly to blame and yet&mdash;and yet she could
not reason out her excuse and she could not explain.
She heard the clock strike “Twelve!”&mdash;“one”&mdash;“two”&mdash;and
then, at last, worn out and thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
miserable she fell asleep and slept until long after her
usual time for rising.</p>

<p>This morning there was no kindly Hannah to oversee
her bath; no friendly Priscilla to frolic with.
Everything was lonely, still, and discouraging. She
ate her breakfast in silence and then wandered off to
the nursery window and gazed out disconsolately into
the blinding brightness of the sunny grounds below.
Presently she heard the sound of wheels crunching on
the gravel of the driveway and saw the doctor’s carriage
swing briskly around the sweep in front of the
house. She slipped quickly down-stairs and flew
breathlessly out into the vestibule, just in time to
meet Dr. Crosby on his way into the hall.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, little lady!” he said genially, resting
a kind hand for a moment upon her shoulder and
looking narrowly into her pale, anxious, tear-stained
face. “And how do you do this fine, hot morning?”</p>

<p>Polly nodded gratefully and tried to say, “Very
well, I thank you,” but could not quite accomplish it.
The doctor saw she had something upon her mind and
patiently waited to learn what it was. At last she
was able to speak.</p>

<p>“Priscilla,” she stammered. “Is Priscilla going to&mdash;going
to&mdash;be worse?”</p>

<p>“Why, bless your heart, no,” Dr. Crosby replied
promptly. “On the contrary Priscilla is going to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
better very soon, quite well, in fact. When I left her
at four o’clock this morning she was sleeping soundly,
and if she has rested well ever since, we’ll have her up
and about in no time. So don’t be down-hearted,
child. I suppose you are the Polly Priscilla has had
so much to say about, and you’re fretting because she
has sick notions and doesn’t want to see you? Pooh,
pooh! never mind that! We’ll send her away somewhere
for a few weeks for a change, and by the time
she comes back she will have forgotten all about it
and you’ll be as good friends as ever,” and with that,
and an encouraging pat upon the head, the good-hearted
doctor hurried up-stairs.</p>

<p>Polly crept back to the nursery only half-comforted.
Priscilla might be better and, if she were, of course,
that would be an immense relief, but in the meantime
she was angry at Polly and would have to be taken
away before she would get over it.</p>

<p>Presently there were the sounds of opening and
closing doors on the floor below; the doctor’s cheery
voice was raised in a jovial laugh, and, after a moment,
Hannah came up-stairs looking tired and
hollow-eyed, to be sure, but still smiling and happy.</p>

<p>“Thanks be to God,” she said reverently, “the
child is better. She’s had five hours of steady sleep,
and the rest has done her a world of good. She’s her
own dear, quiet little self again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I can go to her?” cried Polly, springing up
eagerly. “She isn’t angry at me any more, now she’s
better?”</p>

<p>Hannah hesitated. “Well, I can’t say exactly that,”
she replied. “I asked her if she didn’t want to see
you and she shook her head. It’s just a whim of
course, but it wouldn’t do to force her against her
will while she’s so weak, so you’ll just have to wait
patiently till she comes around of herself. Meanwhile
Mrs. Duer wants to have you come to her in the living-room.
There, there, child! don’t look like that!
You’ve nothing to fear. Just keep up a brave heart,
answer her questions truthfully and don’t cry, or tire
her with a long story. She hasn’t slept a wink all
night and she needs rest as much as Priscilla does, so
be quick about what you have to say; only speak when
you’re spoken to and leave her to catch a nap if she
can.”</p>

<p>How she got down to the living-room door Polly
did not know. The brave heart Hannah had bade
her keep up must have sunk to the region of her shoes,
for her feet were as heavy as lead and her left side
felt quite sickeningly empty and hollow. She managed
to give the door a gentle tap, and when Mrs.
Duer’s gentle voice said, “Come in!” she crossed the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Polly!” said Priscilla’s mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
kindly from where she lay on the couch by the open
French windows.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” responded Polly from between
two stiffened lips.</p>

<p>“Come over here, dear, and sit upon this cushion
beside me. I want to ask you a few questions about
yesterday. I’m sure you can answer them satisfactorily.
There! That is right! Now, you know,
dear, Priscilla had a serious shock yesterday, and for
a number of hours she was not responsible for what
she said. She said strange things which we do not
believe are true. I’m sure, for instance, that you
would not refuse to get her doll for her if she asked
you to do so.”</p>

<p>Polly did not answer.</p>

<p>“You did not refuse to get her doll for her, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Duer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer’s pale cheeks flushed a little. “I’m
sorry,” she said. “I’m very sorry and disappointed,
Polly. That was not like you; it was hardly kind, I
think. But I am quite confident you did not shake
Priscilla because she continued to ask you to get her
doll after you had refused. Tell me, dear, you did not
shake Priscilla?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Duer.”</p>

<p>For a second or two the room was very quiet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Polly was having a mighty struggle with herself.
Hannah had told her only to speak when she was
spoken to, and yet she knew that her answers to
Mrs. Duer’s questions, truthful though they were, did
not give a just account of the trouble between her
and Priscilla. There was something amiss somewhere
that she could not straighten out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer, meanwhile, was struggling on her side
to conquer the feeling that had grown in her against
this ungrateful little girl for whom she had done so
much.</p>

<p>At length she spoke again.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry and very much disappointed,
Polly. I never could have believed that you would
grieve me so. To raise your hand against gentle little
Priscilla, who is so delicate and who loved you so much!
Well, child, I suppose you did not realize what you
were doing, and you certainly look as if you had
suffered for your fault. Still, I do not feel as if I
could ever trust you again with my little girl.”</p>

<p>Then somehow, in spite of Hannah, in spite of
everything, Polly’s self-control gave way. “I wasn’t
to blame! I wasn’t to blame!” she cried chokingly,
over and over again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer sighed. “I am willing to believe you did
not mean to be to blame,” she admitted patiently.
“But now I want to tell you that I have decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
take Priscilla away for a while. She needs a change
and it will be better for you both to be separated for
the present. Hannah will go with me, but you can
stay on here while we are gone, at least, and Theresa
will look after you. I am sure you will be a good and
obedient child and do just as she tells you, so that I
shall not have to be anxious on your account while I
am absent. You have been honest in confessing the
truth and so I am willing to believe you will keep
your promise if you give me your word you will be
good and obedient while I am away and will do as
Theresa tells you. Will you, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Duer.”</p>

<p>“You will not go outside the gates unless Theresa
goes with you?”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Duer.”</p>

<p>“And you will remember your promise to obey her
absolutely?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, Mrs. Duer.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now I think you may go up-stairs, or
out under the trees to play, or anywhere within the
grounds that you choose.”</p>

<p>But Polly still lingered, trying to utter the words
that were catching so cruelly in her throat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer wondered a little why she did not start.</p>

<p>“May I&mdash;may I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May you what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I go back to&mdash;to the&mdash;store again, please?”</p>

<p>“To the store? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Where I was when Miss Cissy came. Mr. Phelps&mdash;he’s
the superintendent&mdash;said I&mdash;he would take me
back any time. He said I was a trustable&mdash;he said I
was a good cash-girl and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; I’d like to go, if
you don’t mind,” Polly murmured in broken breaths.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer raised herself upon her elbow. “Ah,
but I do mind,” she replied instantly. “On no consideration
can you go back. In the first place you
would have nowhere to stay&mdash;your sister at the hospital
could not have you&mdash;and then,&mdash;but it is quite
out of the question and we won’t discuss it further.”</p>

<p>Polly turned slowly and went toward the door.
She had to grope her way because of the blur before
her eyes that shut out everything, but at last she managed
to lay her hand upon the knob and to turn it.
The next moment she was in the cool, dim hall and
the next&mdash;she had hung herself face downward on
the great tiger-skin upon the polished floor and was
crying as if her heart would break. No one saw her;
no one heard her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer in the living-room was trying to rest.
Priscilla was dozing in the darkened bedchamber up-stairs,
with Hannah on guard and James was carrying
down from the attic the trunks and traveling-bags
that would be needed for the journey, and whistling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cheerfully beneath his breath as he did it, for Mrs.
Duer had told him he might take the occasion of her
absence to go upon a little trip of his own and he was
looking forward to his holiday as eagerly as if he had
been a boy.</p>

<p>But in the midst of her misery Polly remembered
the absurd little rhyme sister had repeated to her that
last day at the hospital:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Good little babies bravely bear a deal,</div>
<div class="verse">They hold their little heads up</div>
<div class="verse">No matter how they feel.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She scrambled to her feet in a twinkling, brushed
away her tears and returned to the nursery where she
busied herself setting her writing-desk in order and
rearranging the articles upon her table. She put the
fragments of her shattered bank into the table-drawer
after vainly trying to fit them together again. It was
the first bank she had ever owned and she reflected
sadly that it would probably be the last. For surely
what Mrs. Duer had meant a little while ago was that
she did not wish Priscilla to play with her any more.
And if Priscilla was not to play with her any more
then&mdash;then&mdash;why then she would be sent away. She
wondered what sister would say; and dear Miss
Cicely! how grieved and disappointed she would be.
And yet, if Miss Cicely were here Polly felt she could
make her understand the things she could not explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to Mrs. Duer&mdash;the things that would show she was
not so entirely blamable as she seemed. Yes, Miss
Cicely would certainly understand. As for Hannah&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Good Hannah found an opportunity, in the midst of
all her hurry and worry, to run up-stairs to the nursery
for a minute, just before bedtime and to say in a
confidential whisper:</p>

<p>“There now, Polly, don’t you go to fretting yourself
to skin and bone over this. Just you keep still
and be good and it will all come out right in the end.”</p>

<p>“But Hannah, oh, Hannah,” Polly groaned. “Priscilla’s
angry at me, and she stays angry. And Mrs.
Duer said she couldn’t trust me any more.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, it’s hard, I know, but all the same, be
a good girl and I warrant things will come out right
in the end. We won’t be gone so very long and when
we come back who knows what may happen.”</p>

<p>So Polly went to sleep with a more hopeful heart
than she had carried for many hours and the next
morning she watched the travelers depart with what
was almost a smile of contentment, for was she not
going to be the best and most obedient of girls while
they were gone, so that when they came back&mdash;who
knew what might happen?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TELEGRAM</span></h2>

<p>The days dragged slowly by; hot, sultry, lonely
days. There was nothing much for a little girl to do
in the great empty house, and Polly wandered about
rather disconsolately at first, missing good Hannah
and Priscilla at every turn and learning anew how
dear they had become to her. There was not much
fun in playing with her doll when there was no one
to join in the game. She visited Oh-my in his stable
and found the greatest consolation in telling him her
secrets and feeling that he understood and sympathized
with her.</p>

<p>“You see, pony,” she explained, “I haven’t got
anybody to talk to now but you, and it makes me feel
lonesome. Theresa has the charge of me, but she
stays down-stairs mostly and doesn’t pay very much
attention. Besides, James told me she doesn’t like
little girls, and I guess it’s true, for sometimes her
voice isn’t very pleasant when she says things to me
and I’d rather not bother her unless I have to, because
it makes her nervous.”</p>

<p>And Oh-my put his head down and nosed Polly’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
hand in the friendliest, manner possible, as if to say:
“I understand perfectly, my dear. I’ve gone through
the same thing myself, so I know precisely how you
feel.”</p>

<p>But one thunder-stormy day Polly happened to
stroll into the library down-stairs, because the nursery
seemed so far off when the lightning was flashing and
the great, crashing peals made one’s breath clutch
at one’s throat, and as it happened, that was the last
of her loneliness, for how could one possibly feel solitary
with such a multitude of delightful friends as she
found in those well-filled book-shelves? She forgot
the storm, forgot the heat, forgot everything, in fact,
but the new world she had found and that proved so
full of endless delights and surprises.</p>

<p>She did not venture to take any of the volumes
very far from their shelves, but she discovered it was
thoroughly comfortable, as well as convenient, to
cuddle back of the library curtains on the wide window-sill,
and, in this hidden nook with her new-found
treasures to keep her company, she was entirely happy
and remained lost to the world for hours at a time.
So long as she appeared promptly at meal-time
Theresa did not care where she was, so Polly got
through the days much bettor than could have been
expected and before she realized it, it was drawing
near the time when the travelers should return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Priscilla was causing her mother and
Hannah no end of disappointment and worry. The
railroad journeys tired and bored her since there was
no lively Polly across the aisle to invent new plays
for her or take the lead in the old ones. She sat upon
the beach at the seashore and could not be induced to
stir from Hannah’s side. Once or twice, some sociable
child, anxious to make friends, would venture up and
ask if she did not want to come and play, but Priscilla
always turned away her head shyly and refused
to be neighborly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go and play with that nice little
girl, Priscilla?” Hannah urged. “She’s a real little
lady. I’ve watched her ever since we came on the
sands and I’ve never seen her cross or selfish. Go
along, dear! You’ll have lots of fun.”</p>

<p>But Priscilla shook her head. “I don’t want to,”
she murmured wistfully. “She doesn’t play the
right way. Not&mdash;not&mdash;the way Polly does. Polly
plays the best way. If Polly were here I’d play.”</p>

<p>The fresh sea-air brought the color back to her
cheeks and she grew thoroughly strong and well
again, but she was languid and restless and nothing
appeared to please her.</p>

<p>After three weeks of this her mother grew fairly
discouraged.</p>

<p>“We have tried the seaside and we have tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
mountains,” she declared mournfully to Hannah, after
a particularly dreary day in which everything had
gone wrong with Priscilla. “She doesn’t seem contented
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“She’s not sick, that’s certain,” Hannah assured her
consolingly. “The doctors all say there’s nothing the
matter with her. Dr. Crosby told me he thought it
was just a miracle the way she got over the shock of
that fall. He said it wouldn’t have been possible if
she were as she used to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know she is not sick,” went on the anxious
mother, “but her spirits do not improve. She was so
happy and merry this summer, it was a pleasure to
see her. Her aunts and uncles all remarked what a
different child she was, but now&mdash;ever since her fall&mdash;she
has been going back to her old listless, moody
ways again. I am utterly distressed about her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, I wouldn’t feel like that,” ventured
Hannah, who in her heart felt entirely the same, but
wouldn’t have admitted it for the world.</p>

<p>Just then Priscilla herself wandered into the room.
The corners of her mouth were drooping and her
eyes looked quite ready for tears.</p>

<p>Her mother held out her arms and the little girl
went to her silently.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Mrs. Duer, kissing the mournful
lips and stroking back the glossy hair with a loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hand, “I wonder what pleasant plan we can make
for to-morrow. What would you like to do, little
daughter?”</p>

<p>For answer Priscilla suddenly buried her face in
her mother’s neck and began to cry.</p>

<p>“Why, what is it, darling?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” came back in a broken whisper.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like it here, dear?”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go away?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, please.”</p>

<p>“Very well, dear. We can leave to-morrow. And
we’ll go anywhere you choose.”</p>

<p>Priscilla raised her head and her eyes were shining
with pleasure as well as tears.</p>

<p>“Really?&mdash;Truly?” she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, pet,” her mother assured her in surprise.
“Certainly we can go to-morrow and anywhere
you choose.&mdash;Back to the mountains if you like.”</p>

<p>Priscilla’s face fell and all the light went out of it.
Her lip began to quiver. Her mother and Hannah
exchanged puzzled glances over her head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go back to the mountains?”
Mrs. Duer asked gently.</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have plenty of time, dear. We can go
where you like. We need not hurry home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>But somehow this comforting assurance seemed
only to start Priscilla’s tears afresh.</p>

<p>“I don’t want plenty of time,” she wailed dolefully.</p>

<p>A sudden idea popped into Hannah’s head. She
gave Mrs. Duer a quick glance and then said quietly:
“I shouldn’t want to hurry you on any account,
madam, but perhaps if we were to go home for a day
or two Priscilla might make up her mind better where
she’d like to be. If we didn’t stay out the rest of our
time here, for instance, we could go right home
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But Priscilla had started up, her eyes aglow. Hannah
pretended not to notice her and continued unconcernedly:
“We could telegraph to Theresa to-night
that we were coming to-morrow and, if we started
bright and early we could be home by evening, sure.”</p>

<p>Priscilla clapped her hands. “And s’posing Lawrence
and Richard would meet us at the station!” she
cried, half-laughing, half-crying, her voice quivering
with excitement: “and s’posing Oh-my was there too&mdash;and&mdash;and
s’posing&mdash;s’posing Polly was driving him&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder one mite if I were to ask the
telegraph operator down in the office to send that
telegram to Theresa,” declared Hannah, “that he’d
send it for me in a minute.”</p>

<p>Priscilla slipped from her mother’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Hannah,” she exclaimed, “would you ask
him, would you?”</p>

<p>Hannah laughed: “Well, dearie, I rather think I
will,” she said.</p>

<p>And that was the end of Priscilla’s low spirits.
For the rest of the afternoon she could hardly contain
herself, and had to be warned of the danger of postponing
their journey if she did not sleep, before she
could be induced to compose herself for bed that
night.</p>

<p>It was plain enough, the child had been homesick.</p>

<p>Early that same evening Polly, from her perch on
the library window seat, saw a bicycle shoot swiftly
around the sweep of the driveway. She was so absorbed
in her book that she hardly raised her eyes to
look at it and was only dimly aware that the rider
wore a uniform of blue, with the cap of a telegraph-messenger
upon his head. But Theresa was not, by any
means, so blind to what was going on about her.
She spied the boy at once and ran down to the kitchen
area-way at the back of the house to receive him.</p>

<p>“Oh, botheration!” she ejaculated as she read the
message. “If this ain’t the most provoking world!
Here I was counting on two more weeks’ vacation at
the very least and making plans and everything and
now comes a telegram to say the whole thing is up
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the cook, full of curiosity at
once.</p>

<p>“Why, the folks are coming-back to-morrow, that’s
what!” Theresa snapped. “And a horrid shame it is
too. Upsetting a body’s arrangements and disappointing
’em of two weeks’ holiday at least. James
is the lucky one! can go off where he chooses and
take it easy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” exclaimed the cook good-naturedly, “is
that all? Goodness! I thought you’d lost your best
friend, you acted so cut up. Why under the sun
shouldn’t the folks come home if they want to? It’s
their house. They ain’t running it altogether for our
convenience, and as to disappointing us of two extra
weeks’ holiday as you call it&mdash;why, that’s just nonsense,
Theresa. We had no right to expect, so we
oughtn’t to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re too good to be true!” Theresa retorted
angrily, as she flounced out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cook looked after her with a broad smile of
amusement on her fat, good-natured face. “Well,
well,” she murmured, comfortably, “Theresa is a
caution, and no mistake. Such a temper as she has
got! And the idea of her being in a fury because the
folks is coming home! Plans! Now, I wonder what
the great plans are that she’s made and that their
coming’ll interfere with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not Theresa’s way to confide her plans
to others and least of all to one who would be pretty
certain to disapprove of them. She knew very well
that the good-hearted cook would never stand by and
see her carry out a cruel plot of revenge against a
helpless child if she were aware of it. And that was
what, to her shame, Theresa had meant to do. She
had by no means forgotten her grudge against Polly
and had intended to take this opportunity to prove it.
But now the elaborate scheme that it had taken her weeks
to contrive was upset, for, with James and Hannah
about again the little girl would be well protected and
she would have no chance to wreak her spite upon her.
She bit her lips savagely as she went up-stairs with the
unwelcome telegram crushed tightly in her palm.</p>

<p>Polly, happening to come out of the library just at
the moment that Theresa was crossing the hall, noticed
the maid’s white lips quiver and, thinking she
was sick or unhappy, broke out at once with an impulsive:
“Oh, Theresa, what’s the matter? Has
anything happened?”</p>

<p>Theresa looked down at her for an instant with an
ugly gleam in her eyes. “Only a telegram,” she muttered
curtly.</p>

<p>Polly’s cheeks whitened. “A telegram!” she
echoed. “They send telegrams when people are sick
or hurt or dead, don’t they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Theresa nodded grimly.</p>

<p>“Is any one you know of sick?” asked poor Polly,
her quick sympathy aroused at once and her thoughts
traveling instantly to sister and reminding her how
badly she would feel if a telegram had come saying sister
was worse.</p>

<p>Again Theresa nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Polly heartily. “I’m ever
and ever so sorry, Theresa. I hope it isn’t your sister.
I know how I’d feel if it was my sister.”</p>

<p>But like a flash of lightning a thought had shot
across Theresa’s brain and before she fairly knew she
was speaking she heard herself say: “It is your
sister!”</p>

<p>All in an instant she saw her way to get Polly out
of the house before the family returned. One plan
was as good as another; if her first had failed, this
would be pretty sure to succeed.</p>

<p>“Yes, child,” she went on, “it’s very sad, but&mdash;now
don’t get excited,&mdash;your sister is very sick! Very,
very sick indeed.”</p>

<p>“Does&mdash;does the telegram say that?” stammered
Polly hoarsely.</p>

<p>“The telegram says,” declared Theresa, unfolding
the paper and pretending to read it: “‘Sister worse.
Wants Polly. Take first train to-morrow morning.’”</p>

<p>Polly clung to the stair-rail for support. She did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not ask to see the telegram. It never entered her innocent
mind that Theresa would stoop to deceive her.
She did not doubt the woman for a moment, there
was no room in her overburdened little heart for anything
but grief over sister.</p>

<p>“Now, Polly,” said Theresa quietly, “you mustn’t
give way. You must have grit and content yourself
for to-night. And to-morrow morning I’ll get you off
by the first train. There won’t be the slightest
trouble about it. I’ll pack your things in a nice
bundle and you can carry it with you.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” broke out Polly in despair, “Mrs.
Duer told me not to go outside the gates&mdash;and I
promised.”</p>

<p>“Unless I went with you,” corrected Theresa.
“She told me all about it and she made you give your
word that you’d mind what I said and do everything
I told you to do.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” cried Polly, still only half-convinced,
“I don’t know the way. I haven’t any
money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” exclaimed the maid. “That’s nothing.
I’ll be glad to give you your carfare and you
haven’t to change cars once all the way. All you
have to do when you’re in the train is to sit still until
you get to the city. Then you walk through the station
and up Madison Avenue for a while and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
you are, right at the hospital door. You can’t possibly
lose your way. It’s as plain as a pipe-stem.
And I’ll wake you early to-morrow morning, before
the rest are up, and you can get away on that first
train.”</p>

<p>Polly’s head was whirling. She passively let
Theresa lead her up-stairs and, in a sort of dream, saw
her make ready a neat bundle containing the very best
of the dainty garments Miss Cissy and Mrs. Duer had
given her. She could not touch her supper, though
Theresa had taken unusual pains to make it an especially
tempting one and kindly urged her, in the
friendliest manner possible, to eat. And later, although
it grew long past her bedtime, her tearless
eyes refused to close. She lay awake staring into the
darkness, hearing the big clock tick and the miserable
little screech-owl moan and thought of sister and
what she would do if&mdash;&mdash; But here she always had
to stop and go back again to the beginning, for she
could not get her thoughts to carry her beyond the
point of sister’s leaving her in the world alone.</p>

<p>She must have fallen into a doze at last, for it was
with a start of surprise that she heard Theresa’s voice
whispering in her ear: “Wake up, Polly! Hurry!
It’s time you were up and dressing! I’ve got a glass
of milk for you and some biscuits, and if you’re quick
you won’t have any trouble getting to the station in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
time for the train,” and knew that it was morning and
that she was back in the world again with that
awful gloom of sister’s being worse hanging over her
and shutting out the sunshine.</p>

<p>Theresa was kindness itself. She helped Polly to
dress, encouraged her to eat her breakfast and quite
laughed with good-natured generosity at Polly’s reluctance
to accept the money for her journey.</p>

<p>“You see, Theresa, I could have paid for it myself,”
the little girl explained, “but I took the money out of
my bank to give to Miss Cissy when I lost the bag the
night of the Fair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did, did you?” said Theresa. “Did Miss
Cissy know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” repeated Polly. “No, I started to
tell her, but she went away. I took all there was in
it. We had to break the bank to get it out. The
pieces are in my table-drawer. I couldn’t bear to
throw them away and, oh, dear!&mdash;now I guess I’d
better go, please. I can’t eat any more, really! And
I’ve drunk all the milk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s a good girl,” the maid said kindly. “Now,
step soft as ever you can so as not to wake anybody.
I’ll go down to the station, or almost down to it, and
see you in the train myself.”</p>

<p>“But it’s such a long walk,” protested poor Polly.
“You’ll get all tired out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing. I’ll carry your bundle and if
we hurry I can be back here in no time&mdash;before
Bridget and the rest are up, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>So, creeping softly and noiselessly down the long,
silent halls and staircases the two stole out of the
house, through the grounds and out into the sunny
stretch of road beyond. It was a long, tiresome
tramp, but Polly was too excited to notice it. She
wanted to hurry, to run, to do anything that would
help her to get to sister more speedily. Theresa
carried her bundle, which was rather heavy, to within
a short distance of the station.</p>

<p>“Now, I can’t go any further with you,” she said as
they reached the last turn in the road, “for it’s getting
late and I ought to be home if I don’t want the
girls to think I&mdash;I’m neglecting my work. But you’re
all right now, you can see the depot there in front of
you. Just you go straight into the waiting-room and
up to the little window in the middle and ask for a
ticket to the city, and if the ticket-seller says ‘return?’
you say ‘No!’ for I couldn’t very well spare
you the money for both ways and have only given
you enough to carry you down. You won’t need any
change after you get there, for the hospital isn’t very
far, and when you get to the hospital your sister will
see to you or some one else will. There’ll be no
trouble about that. Well, run along now and don’t,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
for the life of you, tell anybody what’s the matter or
why you’re going away or anything. It isn’t safe for
little girls to speak to strangers.”</p>

<p>Polly promised and, with rather a heavy pat upon
the shoulder that was meant to seem friendly, Theresa
shoved her forward on her way.</p>

<p>After she had gone the maid stood and watched her
with narrow, eager eyes. She waited there, in fact
hidden from sight behind the roadside trees and
bushes, until she heard the heavy train thunder up and
off again. Then she turned, sped quickly back along
the path she and Polly had come, and reached the
house and the shelter of her own room before any of
the other servants were astir.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT HAPPENED TO POLLY</span></h2>

<p>Priscilla’s spirits rose with every mile that
brought her nearer home. Her mother and Hannah
watched her shining eyes with satisfaction and listened
to the rare sound of her merry chatter as if it had
been the sweetest of music. They were as grateful
for the change in her as sparrows are when, after a
long succession of stormy days, the sun comes out
again.</p>

<p>One question rather puzzled and disturbed her
mother.</p>

<p>What was to be done about Polly after their return?
Priscilla seemed to have forgiven and forgotten
their quarrel and was ready and anxious to make
up and be friends once more, as Hannah had foretold
she would be, but Mrs. Duer could not help remembering
that Polly had raised her hand against her darling
and, she felt that no one could blame her if she were
not willing to trust the child with her again. Priscilla
had so tender and compassionate a little heart
that she could never harbor ill-will against anybody,
but she had barely escaped a dreadful calamity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
her mother felt that it would be worse than reckless
to run the risk of repeating a danger for which,
plainly, Polly was responsible. No; Polly must go,
that was clear, and Priscilla would doubtless soon
cease to miss her, once she was at home again.</p>

<p>But as they drew nearer and nearer their journey’s
end it was easy to see for whom Priscilla’s heart had
been longing, and for what she had been homesick.
She thought and talked of nothing but Polly and her
usually silent little tongue fairly ran over with eager,
anxious chatter.</p>

<p>“S’posing Polly were to be at the station to meet
them!” “S’posing Polly didn’t know they were coming
and would be so surprised she’d jump right up and
down with gladness!” There seemed to be no end
to the delightful things Priscilla amused herself by
“s’posing.”</p>

<p>“When we get home I want to speak to Polly the
first thing,” she confided to Hannah. “I have something
I very p’rtic’larly want to say to her.”</p>

<p>But when the train at last drew up beside the
station and the travelers stepped out upon the platform,
Priscilla’s happy smile faded to a wistful shadow
of itself, for no Polly was awaiting her anywhere
about, as she had fondly encouraged herself to
“s’pose” might be the case. However, in the pleasant
excitement of feeling she was really at home at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
last, she recovered her good spirits and was as gay
and light-hearted as ever during the brisk drive from
the depot.</p>

<p>“I guess Polly will be waiting for us at the gate,”
she managed to whisper eagerly in Hannah’s ear, between
quick little peerings this way and that in the
hope of spying her nearer at hand. But the carriage
rolled through the gate and up the shady avenue
without bringing any waiting Polly into view. Again
Priscilla’s expectant smile grew wistful.</p>

<p>“I s’pose, maybe, she’s waiting for us at the door,”
she murmured still hopefully, and kept her brown
eyes fixed resolutely before her so that, when the carriage
should swing around the sweep in the driveway
and under the porte-cochêre, she might be the
first to call out the glad “Hello!” that would show
Polly she was sorry and wanted to be friends again;
but only Theresa stood upon the steps to receive
them, and Polly was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Priscilla suffered herself to be lifted out of the carriage
without a word. Her chin was quivering a
little but she did not cry. Perhaps Polly was hiding
somewhere and meant to surprise her by springing out
unexpectedly to welcome her with a kiss and a hug.</p>

<p>Priscilla was naturally very timid, but in her eagerness
to find Polly she braved the shadowy staircases
and lonely dim halls without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“P’raps she’s in the nursery and won’t come down
’cause I was horrid and wouldn’t see her before I went
away. Of course that’s it! Why didn’t I think of
it before?” Priscilla reasoned, and she ran along the
upper hall crying, “Polly! Polly! I’m home again!
Where are you, Polly dear?”</p>

<p>But no jolly little figure came bounding forward in
answer to her call and the only sounds to be heard
were those of her own quick-coming breaths and the
solemn ticking of the big clock in the corner. Then
the dimness, the quiet and the sense of her loneliness
and disappointment overcame Priscilla and with a long,
quivering sob she cast herself face downward upon
the nursery-couch, where she and Polly had played so
many happy times and cried the bitterest tears she
had ever shed.</p>

<p>Down-stairs all was in the greatest confusion, for it
seemed that no one was able to inform Mrs. Duer
where Polly was. Lawrence and Richard, the coachman
and groom, declared they had not seen her near the
stables all day: “And she never missed a morning
all the time you were gone, madam, to come out and
give Oh-my an apple or a lump of sugar.”</p>

<p>Theresa declared she had served the child her breakfast
but hadn’t had a glimpse of her since.</p>

<p>“I was so busy getting the place in order, to receive
you, that I hadn’t a minute to think of Polly,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
confessed. “And when she didn’t come in to luncheon
I didn’t feel I could spare the time to hunt for her.”</p>

<p>“And yet I left her especially in your charge,” Mrs.
Duer said, in stern rebuke.</p>

<p>Poor Hannah, tired as she was, set out immediately
with Lawrence and Richard to scour the grounds,
while Mrs. Duer bade the household servants search
the house from garret to cellar.</p>

<p>She herself hastened up to the nursery in the hope
of finding some clue to the mystery of the child’s disappearance.
But all she saw on entering the room
was Priscilla crouching on the rug before the nursery-couch
and crying her heart out from loneliness and
disappointment.</p>

<p>“My dearest, what is it?” asked Mrs. Duer anxiously
hastening to her and gathering her up tenderly
in her arms.</p>

<p>Priscilla hid her tear-stained face in her mother’s
neck. “I want Polly,” she sobbed out brokenly.</p>

<p>“Yes, darling, I know you do,” Mrs. Duer said
gently, “and I have no doubt she will be found in a
very little while. She was here, safe and well, this
morning, and she cannot have wandered far, for I forbade
her to go beyond the gates and I cannot believe
she has disobeyed me.”</p>

<p>“I have something I must p’rtic’larly tell her right
away,” the shaken little voice continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder what it can be?” ventured Mrs. Duer,
encouragingly. “Don’t you think you can confide it
to mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Try.”</p>

<p>The big clock in the corner ticked out the seconds
with melancholy distinctness. It seemed to Priscilla
to be reproachfully repeating: “Pol-ly’s gone!
Pol-ly’s gone!” until she could endure it no longer.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell Polly I was sorry,” she gasped in
a difficult whisper.</p>

<p>“Sorry for what, dearest?”</p>

<p>“The day I fell&mdash;I&mdash;I was horrid to Polly,” went
on the penitent little voice in a broken undertone.
“I&mdash;I wouldn’t play with her first-off when she
wanted me to and then, when she went out to Pine
Lodge, I was lonesome and I wanted her, and so I
went there too. I didn’t have my doll and we
couldn’t play. I asked her to get it ’cause I was
tired. She was tired too; she had a big bump on her
head that hurt her; she let me feel it thump. But&mdash;I
teased her to get my doll; I kept right on teasing.&mdash;She
would have gone then but you’d told her not to
leave me alone there and then&mdash;and then&mdash;I felt
wicked in my heart and wanted to be horrid and&mdash;I
thought it would frighten her if I got up on the
bench where you said I mustn’t. She begged me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
get down&mdash;but I leaned over&mdash;just to tease her. And
I said I’d get down if she’d fetch my doll. At last,
after ever so long, she said she’d go and then I got
down.&mdash;But&mdash;but I guess she was ’xasp’rated, I had
teased her so, and leaned over the edge when she said
I shouldn’t, and wouldn’t even let her hold on to my
skirt and&mdash;and&mdash;so&mdash;she shook me. She ’most cried
the minute she had done it and asked me to forgive
her and make up. But I wouldn’t.&mdash;I don’t know
why I was so horrid;&mdash;it was awful&mdash;it choked me&mdash;but
I couldn’t vanquish it&mdash;I just kept on teasing her
to get my doll.&mdash;Then she did.&mdash;While she was gone
I tried to think of a way to pay her back for shaking
me&mdash;and by and by I thought of one.&mdash;When she
brought the doll I just walked over to the bench and
got up on it again. I did it to pay her back.&mdash;She
begged me not to&mdash;and I did&mdash;and then&mdash;I fell&mdash;and
it wasn’t Polly’s fault and&mdash;I&mdash;I want Polly!”</p>

<p>And this was how Priscilla fought her first great
battle with her conscience and won. Her mother,
hearing her heart flutter and bound, and feeling the
cold drops of moisture on her temples, knew that the
struggle had been a fierce one and loved her all the
better for it.</p>

<p>And somehow Priscilla had never felt so happy in
all her life, in spite of her unhappiness, as she did in
that moment when her beautiful young mother, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
whom she had always stood a little in awe, kissed her
tenderly on her forehead and said: “God bless my
little girl for being honest enough to tell the truth
and brave enough to confess her fault,” and they had
both cried and clung together and felt that they were
very fast friends indeed.</p>

<p>But in the meantime it was growing darker every
moment and still Polly had not been found. Hannah
came hastening up to report that no trace of her had
been discovered anywhere out of doors and Theresa
had no better news to tell of their search within.</p>

<p>“She was all right and well this morning, I do assure
you, madam,” the maid insisted. “I served her
breakfast with my own hands. She seemed terribly
upset, I will own, when you went away, but after a
while it seemed as if she had found something to take
up her mind for she was more contented-like. Since
she’s been missing it has occurred to me that perhaps
she intended to run away and that she was planning
how to do it all the time I thought she was just amusing
herself with books and so on. I never was the
prying kind, but I wonder if it would be a good idea
to look around and see if her things are all here&mdash;her
clothes, I mean, and such-like.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer thought it would be an extremely good
idea and Hannah made haste to the little girl’s bureau
drawers and closet. A great lump rose in her throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as she discovered that the very finest and daintiest of
her garments&mdash;the ones Polly had liked the best&mdash;were
missing from their customary places.</p>

<p>But Theresa was fingering the articles on Polly’s
little table in the corner, pulling the books and papers
about and rummaging among them busily. Suddenly
she gave a start and exclamation:</p>

<p>“It seems to me I remember that there used to be
a little iron bank here somewhere, full of loose change,
wasn’t there, Hannah?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Why?” responded Hannah almost
harshly.</p>

<p>“Because it isn’t here now,” replied Theresa.</p>

<p>“It was Polly’s own bank,” Priscilla whispered in
her mother’s ear. “The money belonged to her, to
do what she liked with. When Cousin Cissy gave
her some or Uncle Arthur did, or anybody, Polly
always put it in her bank, and she said she meant to
buy things with it for some people she knew; and I
guess she meant us.”</p>

<p>While Priscilla was talking Theresa, with a great
ado, pulled open the little drawer of the table. It
came out with a jerk and there, directly before her,
lay the broken fragments of the bank. Without a
word she gathered them up and brought them to her
mistress. They seemed convincing proof that Polly
had deliberately planned to go away (without doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
back to the city) and had taken her savings to pay
her fare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Duer rose. “That is enough, Theresa,” she
said sadly. “Put those pieces back where you found
them, please, and then you can go down-stairs. I shall
not need you here any longer.”</p>

<p>She was anxious to be alone with Hannah.</p>

<p>As soon as the maid had left the room she turned
to the nurse exclaiming: “Oh, Hannah, it seems impossible!
I can’t believe it of the child. She promised
me faithfully not to go beyond the gates and I
trusted her perfectly.”</p>

<p>Hannah hesitated. “Polly thought you didn’t
trust her,” she said quietly. “It was only the night
before we left home that she told me you had said
you couldn’t trust her any more. If it’s true that she
has deliberately gone away I think there’s no doubt
but that’s why. But I’m not ready to believe she’s
run off so without a word of thanks for all the love
and kindness and generosity’s been shown her in this
house. It wouldn’t be like her. I won’t believe it
till I must.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Duer’s thoughts were traveling back to
the last time she had seen the little girl: that afternoon
in the living-room when she had asked her about
Priscilla’s accident, when she had told her she could
not trust her any more. She remembered the hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
look in Polly’s eyes and the quiver in her voice as she
asked to be permitted to go back to the store where&mdash;where&mdash;(it
was all clear to her now) where they did
trust her, where they thought she was “a good cash-girl.”
Like a flash the whole thing explained itself to
Mrs. Duer. Polly had gone back to the city, back to
her old place. In a few hurried words she told Hannah
of what she was thinking:</p>

<p>“I shall telephone at once to the station-master and
learn if she has taken any of the trains from the depot
to-day and if she has I will go to the city the first
thing in the morning and find her, wherever she is,
and bring her back.”</p>

<p>Priscilla’s tears had ceased. The thought of Polly
alone, far off, somewhere in the distant, dangerous
darkness, made her heart stand still with horror.
She followed her mother and Hannah silently down-stairs
and stood by trembling while the telephone bell
tinkled merrily and the dreadful news came back over
the wire that Polly had indeed taken the earliest
morning train that very day for the city and that if
there was anything wrong the station-master was
very sorry, but he had thought it was all right to let
her go, although, now he came to think of it, he had
wondered at her being permitted to take such a long
journey alone. The ticket-seller said he remembered
her particularly, “because she seemed such a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
one to be shifting for herself.” He recollected that
she had bought a ticket to town, but not back, and
had paid for it with a lot of loose change&mdash;“quarters
and dimes and nickles and such.” If he could do anything
for Mrs. Duer she’d oblige him by letting him
know.</p>

<p>But even now Hannah would not believe that Polly
had run away.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see, Mrs. Duer, it’s impossible,”
she exclaimed in real distress. “Polly isn’t disobedient
nor ungrateful nor disloyal and she’d be all of
these and more if she’d gone off so and left us without
a word. There must be some way of explaining it.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Duer was not so sure. She felt terribly
anxious and harassed. What could she say to Polly’s
sister if anything had happened to the child? What
could she do?</p>

<p>Well, certainly nothing to-night. She would take
the earliest train to the city in the morning and in
the meantime they must all get what rest they could.
Priscilla looked white and worn and ought to be put
to bed as soon as she had eaten her supper. But
Priscilla could only choke over her food and beg to
be “excused” from the table. It was a sad ending to
a day that had begun so merrily.</p>

<p>And how was Polly faring all this time?</p>

<p>The journey in the train proved to be tediously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
long and dreary. Quite, quite different from the one
she had taken last, when she and Priscilla had passed
over the same road some months ago, in coming to
the country. After a while she began to feel faint
and sick from the motion of the cars and, though she
did not realize it, from hunger. The cold milk and
hard biscuits of her breakfast were all Theresa had
provided her with, so her usual luncheon time came
and went and she had nothing to eat. Her empty
little stomach rebelled. But she had no thought for
herself, her mind and heart were brimful of sister,
while the train that was carrying her to the city
where sister lay sick&mdash;worse&mdash;seemed to do no more
than slowly crawl. The wheels refused to grind out
pleasant tunes, the hot sun blazed viciously through
the window next which she sat and the dust and
smoke and cinders blew in and settled upon her until
she was covered with grime and grit.</p>

<p>Put at last the end of the journey was reached.
Polly took up her heavy, cumbersome bundle and
stumbled blindly out into the vast, busy station, amid
a babel of voices and a hurrying, struggling press of
passengers. She pushed forward in the thickest of
the crowd and presently found herself in the street,
almost deafened by the clang and clatter of trolley
cars, the shouts of eager hackmen and the piercing
cries of shrill-voiced newsboys. The midday sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
glared blindly into her eyes and beat pitilessly upon
her burning cheeks. She looked about her in dismay,
for she did not know her way about this part of town
and, for the first time in her life, the confusion of the
city terrified her. Theresa had bade her speak to no
one and so she did not venture to ask her way.
Tugging wearily at her bulky burden she, somehow,
got past the line of shouting hackmen standing about
the station steps, and managed to cross the street.
People pushed and jostled her; draymen, with rough,
hoarse voices, ordered her out of the way, and motormen
clanged their bells to warn her off the track.
She stumbled blindly along, hardly knowing where
she set her feet and really wandering straight in the
wrong direction. It seemed to her that she was forgotten
and forsaken by all the world.</p>

<p>She had known her way to and from the store and
around and about the streets near Priscilla’s house,
but here she was all astray. She stood still and tried
to recall Theresa’s directions for reaching the hospital:
“You go through the station and up Madison Avenue
for a while and there you are!”</p>

<p>She had left the station far, far behind and Madison
Avenue was nowhere within sight.</p>

<p>The twine that Theresa had fastened about her
bundle and that had threatened to break from the
time she started out, gave way with a snap. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
would have to gather up the loose ends and knot
them as best she could to prevent her clothes from
strewing the pavement. While she was bungling
awkwardly over this, balancing the bundle unsteadily
against her knee, some one ran heavily against her
and in an instant her bundle was on the sidewalk.
She dared not turn her head or look around for she
felt pretty sure that whoever had jostled her had
done it “on purpose,” since there was no crowd here
and the street was wide. But the next instant she
heard a shrill whistle, a coarse laugh and then a rough
voice crying jeeringly:</p>

<p>“My eyes! But if this ain’t a go! Blest if here
isn’t the fine young lady that lives on the Avenoo!
The lady that ran away with my papers one day along
las’ spring! Hi, though, you don’t get off so easy this
time, sis! I owes you one an’ I’m honest, I am.
When I owes, I pays, see?”</p>

<p>She turned her head, lifted her eyes and stared
straight into the mischievous, leering face of her old
enemy&mdash;the newsboy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOME AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>Strangely enough the sight seemed to give her
courage. She looked fearlessly up at him and met his
twinkling eyes without flinching.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a cool one!” he exclaimed appreciatively.</p>

<p>Polly’s fingers fumbled with the string of her recaptured
bundle, but she said nothing, nor did she
remove her gaze from his face.</p>

<p>“Say now&mdash;you needn’t go to the trouble of tyin’
up that bundle,” the fellow continued. “I’m goin’ to
carry it for you, see? and I won’t want a string.
You didn’t need a string the time you carried my
papers for me, did you? Droppin’ things behind you,
one by one, can be done better without a string!”</p>

<p>Polly simply made a knot in the cord she was
fingering and did not reply.</p>

<p>“I say!” exclaimed the newsboy at last, “what
kind of a girl are you, anyway? Why don’t you
cry?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to cry for,” said Polly, stoutly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, ain’t there! How do you know but I’m goin’
to cuff you over the ear, same’s you did me?”</p>

<p>“Because you won’t. It’s cowardly for a boy to
hit a girl.”</p>

<p>“And how about a girl hittin’ a fellow? Hey?”</p>

<p>“You took my Priscilla’s doll! You made my
Priscilla cry!”</p>

<p>“Why, so I did! And you wouldn’t stand it!
And so you hit me! Well, you’re an out-an’-outer,
and no mistake! Say now, d’you want to know all I
have against you?”</p>

<p>Polly looked at him squarely but was too cautious
to reply.</p>

<p>“You can’t take a joke. You don’t know when a
feller’s funnin’. Why, bless your boots, I wouldn’t
have took the kid’s doll off of her for a farm! I was
only foolin’, just to see what ye’d do and&mdash;my eye!
but the joke was on me&mdash;for you did it! you gave me
as good a chase as I want in a hurry! Say now, I
like you a lot! I like any feller a lot that’s got nerve
and grit and when I like a feller a lot I stand by him!
I’m going to stand by you, see?”</p>

<p>Then suddenly and without any warning Polly felt
her eyes fill.</p>

<p>The newsboy’s face fell. “Say now,” he exclaimed
in a tone of anxious reproach, “you ain’t goin’ to
weaken now, are ye? When there ain’t anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
cry for? An’ me thinkin’ you was an out-an’-outer,
and countin’ on your grit and savin’ I’d stand by
you!”</p>

<p>Polly smiled through the mist in her eyes. “I guess
that’s just what made me,” she confessed. “You see,
I don’t know my way, and my sister’s sick at the
hospital and I can’t find her, and I thought I was all
alone, and when you said you’d stand by me&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The newsboy nodded. “I know,” he assured her
bluffly. “But now, just you leave that whole business
to me. I’ll find the ’ospittle for you without any
trouble at all an’ you wait an’ see if your sister ain’t
better by the time you get there. That bundle of
yours ’s no good. Who did it up? Well, they&mdash;they
didn’t know how, that’s all. Now you see this
leather? It’s what goes around my papers! Just
you watch me strap it round your bundle, fast an’
tight, like this&mdash;so-fashion! There y’ are. See!
Now come along. Step lively and keep off the
grass!”</p>

<p>Polly followed as fast as she could in his swinging
steps. He guided her across the crowded streets as
safely and swiftly as if they had been country lanes
and, though it proved a long, long walk, almost before
she knew it, she found herself at the door of the
hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, I tell you what it is,” explained her escort,
as she turned to thank him. “I’ll wait out here till
you give me the word that everything’s O.K. inside.
If ’tis, why, good enough! I’ll go about my
business, but if it isn’t&mdash;well&mdash;all you’ve got to do is
to give me a nod and I’ll be there for whatever ’s to
be done.”</p>

<p>So Polly went up the steps and timidly rang the
bell. Her heart beat suffocatingly as she asked for
her sister, but no one in the office seemed to be able
to tell anything about her. Some one was sent up-stairs
to enquire and, meanwhile, she sat upon a
wooden bench in the cool, tiled hall and waited. It
seemed ages before the messenger returned. Nurses
flitted through the corridors, laughing and chatting
together, telephone-bells rang, dispatch-boys came
and went and the office was astir with business. But
Polly’s mind and heart were too full for her to feel
any concern in all the interesting bustle and commotion
about her. All she longed for was to be led to
that quiet room up-stairs where sister lay.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged slowly, slowly by, and the
hands of the round-faced clock over the desk in the
office seemed scarcely to move at all. Then, just as
she was beginning to think the messenger had forgotten
her, he returned accompanied by a cheerful-looking
young woman in nurse’s uniform, who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
directly up to Polly and said in a kindly voice: “You
are enquiring about Miss Ruth Carter?”</p>

<p>Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, her nurse has been called away and I don’t
really know much more than this&mdash;that a lady came
for Miss Carter yesterday and took her away. She
isn’t here any more. Another patient has her room.”</p>

<p>Polly stared hopelessly up at the cheerful-looking
young woman and her lips moved but she could not
speak.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are Miss Carter’s little sister? Yes,
I thought you might be. Well, you’ll probably hear
all about her when you get home. If her nurse
hadn’t been called away she could tell you just how
the case stands. I’m new here and don’t know anything
more about Miss Carter than what I’ve told you.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know if she’s worse?” stammered
Polly.</p>

<p>“Why, no&mdash;I don’t,” admitted the nurse.</p>

<p>“Do they&mdash;do they&mdash;ever take them away when
they’re worse?” The cheerful-looking nurse examined
her cuffs with a good deal of interest.</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;sometimes they do,” she replied hesitatingly.
“You know this isn’t a hospital for incurables.
If your sister had been here some time and
she couldn’t be cured, or if she grew worse she would
have to be removed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Polly moved slowly toward the door. The cheerful-looking
nurse did not think it was worth while to take
the trouble of looking up Ruth Carter’s case in the
hospital records just to satisfy a child. She had something
she wanted very much more to do, and so she
let Polly out of the great building with a pleasant,
encouraging smile. The newsboy came whistling
around the corner as soon as the little girl appeared
upon the outer steps.</p>

<p>“Everything O.K.?” he enquired.</p>

<p>Polly shook her head.</p>

<p>“O, I say, nothin’ ’s wrong with the sick lady, is
there?”</p>

<p>Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“She ain’t&mdash;gone?”</p>

<p>Again Polly nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m&mdash;I’m sorry! I say, you’re hard hit and
that’s a fact! Come&mdash;cry if you want to. Never
mind me! It’ll do you good, p’raps. Even a feller’d
be let cry if&mdash;if&mdash;his folks at the ’ospittle was&mdash;gone.”</p>

<p>But Polly did not cry. She was too stunned. The
newsboy joined her and they walked slowly and
silently down the street. At last Polly spoke:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t quite know&mdash;what I’d better do,” she
said drearily. “I haven’t any place to go and I
haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>Her companion whistled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I thought you were one of the four-hundred!
You live on the Avenoo!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the house is shut up. No one is there.
They’re all in the country.”</p>

<p>“What’d they mean then, by lettin’ you come away
alone with no money in your pocket, eh?”</p>

<p>Polly sighed. “I don’t know,” she said wearily.
“A telegram came and Theresa&mdash;she’s the parlor-maid&mdash;told
me it was about sister’s being worse and wanting
me, and Theresa got me ready and&mdash;and&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>The newsboy considered. “Well, Tresser hasn’t
got much sense&mdash;or else&mdash;she’s got too much, that’s all
I have to say about it,” he exclaimed. “But that
ain’t our business just now. What’s our business just
now is this: What are you goin’ to do? Now just
you think. Ain’t there any one&mdash;not a single soul you
know in this friendly town? Not a one? Just make
a try at it, an’ fish up one! One ain’t much! Oh, I
say, I’d be willing to&mdash;to&mdash;declare you can think of
one!”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head.</p>

<p>“We used to live down-town,” she explained. “But
sister and I didn’t know many people there, and besides
they move about a great deal&mdash;the down-town
people do. And all Priscilla’s relations are in the
country. And sister’s nurse at the hospital is away
too and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you, may be, know any one at the ’ospittle besides
your sister?”</p>

<p>“Only Mrs. Bell.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Mrs. Bell?”</p>

<p>“She’s the mother of little Cicely. She isn’t at the
hospital any more. Miss Cissy said she had moved
into a nice little flat.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>Polly gave the street and number.</p>

<p>The newsboy hailed a trolley and the next moment
they were flashing up-town as fast as electricity would
take them. She was too bewildered to know how or
where they went, but blindly followed her leader and
let him pilot her from one car to another without a
word.</p>

<p>Dazed by the heat and her hunger, and stunned by
the blow she had received at the hospital, Polly did
not even realize that they had reached the street in
which, Miss Cissy said, Mrs. Bell lived and was not
conscious of the fact that her companion had rung the
bell of the ground-floor flat and that they were standing
before the door waiting for it to be opened to
them. But, in another moment her wits returned, for
the door was flung open, a flood of mellow sunlight
streamed into the dim hall in which they stood, and
Mrs. Bell’s hearty voice, full of amazement, was crying
out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Polly!&mdash;Polly Carter! What brings you
here?”</p>

<p>The newsboy chuckled. Baby Cicely, in her
mother’s arms, crowed lustily and Polly uttered a
sharp cry of joy&mdash;for there, just before her&mdash;not two
yards away&mdash;stood sister! Smiling and happy and&mdash;well!</p>

<p>Nobody could understand how it had all come
about, perhaps because nobody could keep still long
enough to listen to explanations, but one can be very,
very glad and thankful without quite understanding
just the way the things have occurred that make
one so.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell would not hear of Polly’s protector leaving
her house till he had promised faithfully to come
back again as soon as he had sold out his “Extry
’Dition! Evenin’ Papers!” But when he had given
his word and gone whistling away she set about getting
Polly something to eat, for it was easy to see, in
spite of her joy and excitement, that the child was
worn out with fatigue and faint from hunger.</p>

<p>It was nothing less than luxury to sit in Mrs. Bell’s
best chair, sipping cool, fresh milk and eating a soft-boiled
egg and buttered bread, and seeing sister walk&mdash;really
walk (somewhat slowly, to be sure, and with
the help of a stick, as yet) but still walk&mdash;back and
forth and about the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, little by little, everything began to explain
itself. Polly’s coming to town on account of the telegram
that had never been sent (at which gentle sister’s
eyes shot sparks of righteous indignation); her
meeting with her old enemy, who proved such a
friend (at which sister’s eyes grew soft again);
sister’s having left the hospital the day before, because
she was entirely cured and because Miss Cicely had
arranged to take her up to the country the following
morning as a surprise for Polly, and Mrs. Bell having
the dearest little flat in the world because her husband
had got a good position in Mr. Cameron’s office and
could afford to give her a comfortable home now, in
which she had begged to be allowed to entertain
sister the first day she was out of the hospital. It all
seemed very wonderful and yet very simple, when the
tangles were unraveled. Even the cloud that had
hung over Polly since Priscilla’s accident seemed to
grow lighter when sister knew of it and pointed out
the way to explain the matter to Mrs. Duer. “We
ought to send a dispatch to her at once,” Ruth Carter
declared. “She will be anxious about you, dear,” but
Polly soon explained that Priscilla, her mother and
Hannah were still at the seashore and would not be
back for a week at least, and that as they had not
known she was absent they would hardly worry about
her safety. So it was decided to wait until to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
when Polly would go up to the country with Miss
Cicely and sister and they would all three be there together
to welcome the travelers on their return.</p>

<p>So, while Priscilla and her mother and Hannah
were spending the dolefulest of evenings in the great
country-house, Polly and sister and little Cicely’s parents
and Jim Conroy, the newsboy, were having the
happiest of ones in the little city flat.</p>

<p>Priscilla, in her lonely night-nursery, fell asleep at
last with her cheek pressed against one of Polly’s old
pinafores, which she had smuggled into bed with her
and was clasping lovingly to her breast, while Mrs.
Duer and Hannah sat up late, talking and planning
about the next day and the hurried trip to the city in
search of Polly that both of them felt should be made
without delay. As it happened they were both so
tired that when they did, finally, go to bed, they slept
so soundly that they were late in waking the next
morning and Mrs. Duer missed her train.</p>

<p>Her plan had been to go, directly upon reaching the
city, to the store where she felt pretty confident Polly
had meant to return. But now this idea must be
given up and she must think of another way to get
news of the child. She sent a telegram to the firm
and within an hour received the reply:</p>

<p>“Polly Carter left us in spring. Know nothing of
her present whereabouts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a sort of comfort to Hannah and Priscilla
when James returned, as he did that morning. James
had always seemed to like Polly and he would surely
grieve to hear she had gone. The good nurse told
him everything that had happened, as far as she knew
it, with tears in her voice as well as in her eyes, but
when she came to the part where the broken bank
was made to prove that Polly had used her money to
pay her fare to the city, he sprang up with a shout
and Hannah’s eyes grew dry in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Why, bless your heart,” the butler exclaimed, “I
can tell you all about that bank. I smashed it myself&mdash;the
night of the kirmess. It was this way:&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then out came the story of the little “chamois
bag.”</p>

<p>“And, by the way,” James concluded, “that bag is
somewhere down the ravine this minute, and I’m
going to find it. I was on the way to, when Miss
Priscilla fell and then, in all the hurry and worry, I
clean forgot about it. But the five dollars in it
belongs to Polly&mdash;fair and square&mdash;and I’m going to
get it for her, or my name’s not James Craig.”</p>

<p>“But James,” interposed Hannah, “even if Polly
didn’t take the money to pay her fare, the fact remains
that she’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, true enough,” admitted James, “but if
Mrs. Duer told Polly not to go out of the gates unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Theresa gave her leave, you may be pretty certain
Polly didn’t do it. The kind of character a person
has stands for something, as I look at it, and Polly
has proved she’s the right sort, clear through. You
mark my words, Hannah, there’s a screw loose somewhere,
but it ain’t with Polly.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="460" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHE RUSHED WILDLY FORWARD</p>
</div>

<p>So James strode off to the ravine to search for the
little “chamois bag,” and Hannah hastened back to
Mrs. Duer to repeat to her what the butler had just
been saying. His cheery air and encouraging words
seemed to lift a weight from the heart of every one in
the house except Theresa. She was plunged in the
deepest gloom, for she seemed to see possibilities of
her deception being discovered and she made up her
mind that if the truth of the telegram were brought
to light she would leave the house of her own accord
rather than risk the disgrace of being discharged by
Mrs. Duer. She had not had an easy moment since she
saw the train sweep by that was carrying Polly into
the sweltering city on her hopeless errand. She had
been haunted by the vision of her trusting, sorrowful
eyes as they had looked when she, Theresa, had told
her of the telegram and Polly had thought it contained
bad news for her. The memory seemed to
stab her every time she thought of the child, and,
somehow, she thought of the child continually. She
did not really believe Polly would come back. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
chances were too many against her. She had no
money, no friends in the city save the sister whom
it was improbable she would find and the heat in
town was reported to be prostrating. To her surprise
Theresa found herself worrying about the little girl’s
danger and her heart softened in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“The poor scrap,” she muttered uneasily, “I hope
she’ll come to no harm. Who knows, if Angeline had
been like her, I might have been different&mdash;better!&mdash;And
then, again, who knows, if I’d been like her,
Angeline might have been different&mdash;better. Perhaps
I’ll try, if I go away from here, to be nicer to
Angeline and maybe, if I am, and her mother helps
me, we can make a good child of her, after all. And
maybe we’ll be better, helping her, you can’t
tell.”</p>

<p>Theresa’s eyes grew curiously blurred and dim at
the vision and her hard, handsome face took on a very
gentle, softened look. But all of a sudden its expression
changed to one of eager anxiety. She dropped
Mrs. Duer’s brush and comb, with a handful of other
toilet articles she had been in the act of replacing in
the traveling-bag, which her mistress intended taking
with her when she went to the city, as she expected
to do, that afternoon; flew to the window and gazed
out in a sort of trance of amazement, for there, coming
around the driveway, was one of the station hacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and in it were Miss Cicely, Polly and some one else
whom, she knew at a glance, to be sister herself.</p>

<p>Priscilla had lain hidden away in a shady corner of
the veranda since breakfast, mourning lonesomely, and
refusing to be comforted, when the sound of wheels
upon the gravel made her look up. One glance was
enough. She was on her feet in an instant, rushing
wildly to the carriage entrance and crying: “Polly!
Oh, my Polly! My Polly!” between a shower of
happy tears and a quiver of joyous laughter.</p>

<p>Polly’s wistful face lit up with sudden surprise.
Her lips trembled and her cheeks grew pale. For a
moment she could not speak; her heart was too full.
But Priscilla, frantic with delight, noticed nothing
but that she had her Polly back again.</p>

<p>“Polly, oh, my Polly! My Polly!” she repeated
over and over, while James came running around the
side of the house at the sound of her happy voice,
victoriously swinging the recaptured “chamois bag”
above his head, and Mrs. Duer and Hannah appeared
simultaneously from the house to join in the general
jollification.</p>

<p>It was a reception to be remembered.</p>

<p>Priscilla clung to Polly and would not let her out
of her sight for an instant. Even the beloved Cousin
Cicely had to take second place on this occasion, but
far from objecting, she joined with the others in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the little wanderer a royal welcome home and told
the story of her trials with so much truth and tenderness
that&mdash;well, even James was guilty of a stealthy
sniff as he listened to the recital.</p>

<p>Lawrence and Richard came up from the stables for
the express purpose of shaking Polly by the hand and
telling her they were glad to have her back again
and Bridget and the rest had to be allowed to give
their greeting too, while the only one who did not
appear was Theresa and even she, it proved, had left
her message behind her, for later in the day Polly,
on going to the nursery, discovered a hurriedly-written
note upon her bureau which read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I’m going away. I’m sorry I acted mean to you.
Tell them to send my trunk where it’s directed to.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Theresa.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>So Polly’s cup of bliss was filled to the brim and,
as if it needed one drop more for good measure,
pressed down and running over, Miss Cicely supplied
it in the wonderful secret she had to tell and which
sounded very much like the ending to the story she
had told sister that memorable day of the tea-party
in the hospital.</p>

<p>“But,” concluded Miss Cicely, “if the Person and
The-Real-one-with-the-Heart are to get married, as
they certainly hope to do very soon, why, I’m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they will have to ask two little girls they know to
assist them through the ceremony. The two little
girls must consent to be dressed in white and lead the
bridal procession up the church aisle, for though there
will be plenty of blossoms to be had for the buying,
there are none the Person and The-Real-one-with-the-Heart
like quite so much as the ones we call&mdash;Sweet-P’s.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
